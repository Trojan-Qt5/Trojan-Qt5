 Purpose     :  README for Privoxy

 See LICENSE.

 ========================================================================
 NOTE: Please read developer-manual/documentation.html before touching
 anything in this, or other Privoxy documentation. You have been warned!
 Failure to abide by this rule will result in the revocation of your license
 to live a peaceful existence!
 ========================================================================

 ===================================================================
 READ: Document Note: This file generates the README in the top level
 source directory. It is generated as only a plain text file. The
 current markup is not suitable for other formats. Build from
 Makefile with 'make dok-readme'.
 ===================================================================

 READ:

 ======================================================================
 NOTE: The left margin spacing is *important* when using 'literallayout'
 WYSISWYG!!! Don't mess this up!!! Careful with linebreaks too, ie
 the para tag forces a linebreak. Tags need to be carefully placed as a result
 to avoid extra blank lines, etc.
 ======================================================================

 For stable releases, change

  entity % p-not-stable "INCLUDE"

 to

  entity % p-not-stable "IGNORE"

 in the DTD at the top. This will toggle various text 'off'. BOTH
 MUST be toggled in this case or you will get both text referencing
 stable and unstable versions. You only want one or the other!

 look at the "ChangeLog", the "What's New" section or
 the "Upgrader's Notes" in <citetitle>the User Manual</citetitle>.

<para>
 See the man page or <citetitle>User Manual</citetitle> for an explanation of each option, and
 other configuration and usage issues.
</para>
<para>
 If no config_file is specified on the command line, Privoxy will look for a
 file named 'config' in the current directory (except Win32 which will look
 for 'config.txt'). If no config_file is found, Privoxy will fail to start.
</para>
</sect1>

<!--   ~~~~~       New section      ~~~~~     -->
<sect1 id="configuration"><title>CONFIGURATION</title>
<para>
 See: 'config', 'default.action', 'user.action', 'default.filter', and
 'user.filter'. 'user.action' and 'user.filter' are for personal and local
 configuration preferences. These are all well commented. Most of the magic is
 in '*.action' files. 'user.action' should be used for any actions
 customizations. On Unix-like systems, these files are typically installed in
 /etc/privoxy.  On Windows, then wherever the executable itself is installed.
 There are many significant changes and advances from earlier versions. The
 <citetitle>User Manual</citetitle> has an explanation of all configuration
 options, and examples: https://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/.
</para>
<para>
 Be sure to set your browser(s) for HTTP/HTTPS Proxy at &lt;IP&gt;:&lt;Port&gt;, or
 whatever you specify in the config file under 'listen-address'. DEFAULT is
 127.0.0.1:8118. Note that Privoxy ONLY proxies HTTP (and HTTPS) traffic. Do not try it
 with FTP or other protocols for the simple reason it does not work.
</para>
<para>
 The actions list can be configured via the web interface accessed via
 http://p.p/, as well other options.
</para>

 may not be completed at this point]]>. In particular, see the
 <citetitle>User Manual</citetitle> there,
 the <citetitle>FAQ</citetitle>, and those interested in Privoxy development, should look at
 <citetitle>developer-manual</citetitle>.

 <![%p-not-stable;[
 The most up to date source of information on the current development version,
 may still be either comments in the source code, or the included

 'default.filter'<![%p-not-stable;[ in the top-level source directory]]>.
