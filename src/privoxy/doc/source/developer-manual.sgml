 The developer manual provides guidance on coding, testing, packaging, documentation
 and other issues of importance to those involved with
 <application>Privoxy</application> development. It is mandatory (and helpful!) reading
 for anyone who wants to join the team. Note that it's currently out of date
 and may not be entirely correct. As always, patches are welcome.

     <application>Privoxy</application>, as an heir to
     <application>Junkbuster</application>, is a Free Software project
     and the code is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.
     As such, <application>Privoxy</application> development is potentially open
     to anyone who has the time, knowledge, and desire to contribute
     in any capacity. Our goals are simply to continue the mission,
     to improve <application>Privoxy</application>, and
     to make it available to as wide an audience as possible.

    <para>
     One does not have to be a programmer to contribute. Packaging, testing,
     documenting and porting, are all important jobs as well.

    <para>
      If you become part of the active development team, you will eventually
      need write access to our holy grail, the Git repository. One of the
      team members will need to set this up for you. Please read
      this chapter completely before accessing via Git.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="gitaccess"><title>Access to Git</title>
      <para>
        The project's Git repository is hosted at the
        <ulink url="https://privoxy.org/">Privoxy site.</ulink>
        The Git repository URL is
        <literal>ssh://git@git.privoxy.org:23/git/privoxy.git</literal>,
        the central repository is called <literal>privoxy</literal>, and the
        source branch is called <literal>master</literal>. Subfolders exist
        within the project for target-dependent build and  packaging tools, each
        including the name of the target operating system in their name (e.g.
        Windows, OSXPackageBuilder, debian). There is a webview of the Git
        hierarchy at
        <ulink url="https://www.privoxy.org/gitweb/?p=privoxy.git;a=tree">
                    https://www.privoxy.org/gitweb/?p=privoxy.git;a=tree</ulink>,
        which might help with visualizing how these pieces fit together.

    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="gitbranches">
    <title>Branches</title>
     <para>
       Whilst the central repository contains only the master branch, developers
       are of course free to create branches in their local repositories as they
       develop features, fixes, or update the target-dependent tools. Only once
       such changes are fully tested ought they be pushed back to the central
       repository master branch.
     </para>
     <!--
     <para>
       Branches are used to fork a sub-development path from the main trunk.
       Within the <literal>current</literal> module where the sources are, there
       is always at least one <quote>branch</quote> from the main trunk
       devoted to a stable release series. The main trunk is where active
       development takes place for the next stable series (e.g. 3.2.x).
       So just prior to each stable series (e.g. 3.0.x), a branch is created
       just for stable series releases (e.g. 3.0.0 -> 3.0.1 -> 3.0.2, etc).
       Once the initial stable release of any stable branch has taken place,
       this branch is <emphasis>only used for bugfixes</emphasis>, which have
       had prior testing before being committed to Git. (See <link
       linkend="versionnumbers">Version Numbers</link> below for details on
       versioning.)
     </para>
     -->
     <para>
      At one time there were two distinct branches: stable and unstable. The
      more drastic changes were to be in the unstable branch. These branches
      have now been merged to minimize time and effort of maintaining two
      branches.
     </para>
    <!--
     <para>
       This will result in at least two active branches, which means there may
       be occasions that require the same (or similar) item to be
       checked into to two different places (assuming its a bugfix and needs
       fixing in both the stable and unstable trees). This also means that in
       order to have access to both trees, both will have to be checked out
       separately. Use the <literal>cvs -r</literal> flag to check out a
       branch, e.g: <literal>cvs co -r v_3_0_branch current</literal>.

<sect1 id="documentation"><title>Documentation Guidelines</title>
  <para>
    All formal documents are maintained in Docbook SGML and located in the
    <computeroutput>doc/source/*</computeroutput> directory. You will need
    <ulink url="http://www.docbook.org">Docbook</ulink>, the Docbook
    DTD's and the Docbook modular stylesheets (or comparable alternatives),
    and either <application>jade</application> or
    <application>openjade</application> (recommended) installed in order to
    build docs from source. Currently there is <ulink
    url="../user-manual/index.html"><citetitle>user-manual</citetitle></ulink>,
    <ulink url="../faq/index.html"><citetitle>FAQ</citetitle></ulink>, and, of
    course this, the <citetitle>developer-manual</citetitle> in this format.
    The <citetitle>README</citetitle>, <citetitle>AUTHORS</citetitle>,
    <citetitle>INSTALL</citetitle>,
    <citetitle>privoxy.1</citetitle> (man page), and
    <citetitle>config</citetitle> files are also now maintained as Docbook
    SGML. These files, when built, in the top-level source directory are
    generated files! Also, the <application>Privoxy</application> <filename>index.html</filename> (and a
    variation on this file, <filename>privoxy-index.html</filename>,
    meant for inclusion with doc packages), are maintained as SGML as well.
    <emphasis>DO NOT edit these directly</emphasis>. Edit the SGML source, or
    contact someone involved in the documentation.
    </para>
    <para>
     <filename>config</filename> requires some special handling. The reason it
     is maintained this way is so that the extensive comments in the file
     mirror those in <citetitle>user-manual</citetitle>. But the conversion
     process requires going from SGML to HTML to text to special formatting
     required for the embedded comments. Some of this does not survive so
     well. Especially some of the examples that are longer than 80 characters.
     The build process for this file outputs to <filename>config.new</filename>,
     which should be reviewed for errors and mis-formatting. Once satisfied
     that it is correct, then it should be hand copied to
     <filename>config</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
     Other, less formal documents (e.g. <filename>LICENSE</filename>) are
     maintained as plain text files in the top-level source directory.
    </para>
    <para>
     Packagers are encouraged to include this documentation. For those without
     the ability to build the docs locally, text versions of each are kept in
     Git. HTML versions are also being kept in Git under
     <filename>doc/webserver/*</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
     Formal documents are built with the Makefile targets of
     <computeroutput>make dok</computeroutput>.
     The build process uses the document SGML sources in
     <computeroutput>doc/source/*/*</computeroutput> to update all text files in
     <computeroutput>doc/text/</computeroutput> and to update all HTML
     documents in <computeroutput>doc/webserver/</computeroutput>.

    <para>
     Documentation writers should please make sure documents build
     successfully before committing to Git, if possible.

   Finished docs should be occasionally submitted to Git

<sect2 id="sgml">
<title>Quickstart to Docbook and SGML</title>
<para>
 If you are not familiar with SGML, it is a markup language similar to HTML.
 Actually, not a mark up language per se, but a language used to define
 markup languages. In fact, HTML is an SGML application. Both will use
 <quote>tags</quote> to format text and other content. SGML tags can be much
 more varied, and flexible, but do much of the same kinds of things. The tags,
 or <quote>elements</quote>, are definable in SGML. There is no set
 <quote>standards</quote>. Since we are using
 <application>Docbook</application>, our tags are those that are defined by
 <application>Docbook</application>. Much of how the finish document is
 rendered is determined by the <quote>stylesheets</quote>.
 The stylesheets determine how each tag gets translated to HTML, or other
 formats.
</para>

<para>
 Tags in Docbook SGML need to be always <quote>closed</quote>. If not, you
 will likely generate errors. Example: <literal>&lt;title&gt;My
 Title&lt;/title&gt;</literal>. They are also case-insensitive, but we
 strongly suggest using all lower case. This keeps compatibility with
 [Docbook] <application>XML</application>.
</para>

<para>
 Our documents use <quote>sections</quote> for the most part. Sections
 will be processed into HTML headers (e.g. <literal>h1</literal> for
 <literal>sect1</literal>). The <application>Docbook</application> stylesheets
 will use these to also generate the Table of Contents for each doc. Our
 TOC's are set to a depth of three. Meaning <literal>sect1</literal>,
 <literal>sect2</literal>, and <literal>sect3</literal> will have TOC
 entries, but <literal>sect4</literal> will not. Each section requires
 a <literal>&lt;title&gt;</literal> element, and at least one
 <literal>&lt;para&gt;</literal>. There is a limit of five section
 levels in Docbook, but generally three should be sufficient for our
 purposes.
</para>

<para>
 Some common elements that you likely will use:
</para>

  <simplelist>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;para&gt;&lt;/para&gt;</emphasis>, paragraph delimiter. Most
      text needs to be within paragraph elements (there are some exceptions).
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;emphasis&gt;&lt;/emphasis&gt;</emphasis>, the stylesheets
      make this italics.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;filename&gt;&lt;/filename&gt;</emphasis>, files and directories.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;command&gt;&lt;/command&gt;</emphasis>, command examples.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;literallayout&gt;&lt;/literallayout&gt;</emphasis>, like
      <literal>&lt;pre&gt;</literal>, more or less.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;itemizedlist&gt;&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;</emphasis>, list with bullets.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;</emphasis>, member of the above.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;screen&gt;&lt;/screen&gt;</emphasis>, screen output, implies
      <literal>&lt;literallayout&gt;</literal>.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;ulink url="example.com"&gt;&lt;/ulink&gt;</emphasis>, like
      HTML <literal>&lt;a&gt;</literal> tag.
    </member>
    <member>
      <emphasis>&lt;quote&gt;&lt;/quote&gt;</emphasis>, for, doh, quoting text.

 <sect2><title>Privoxy Custom Entities</title>
 <para>
  <application>Privoxy</application> documentation is using
  a number of customized <quote>entities</quote> to facilitate
  documentation maintenance.
 </para>
 <para>
  We are using a set of <quote>boilerplate</quote> files with generic text,
  that is used by multiple docs. This way we can write something once, and use
  it repeatedly without having to re-write the same content over and over again.
  If editing such a file, keep in mind that it should be
  <emphasis>generic</emphasis>. That is the purpose; so it can be used in varying
  contexts without additional modifications.
 </para>
 <para>
  We are also using what <application>Docbook</application> calls
  <quote>internal entities</quote>. These are like variables in
  programming. Well, sort of. For instance, we have the
  <literal>p-version</literal> entity that contains the current
  <application>Privoxy</application> version string. You are strongly
  encouraged to use these where possible. Some of these obviously
  require re-setting with each release (done by the Makefile). A sampling of
  custom entities are listed below. See any of the main docs for examples.
 </para>

  <itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
   <para>
    Re- <quote>boilerplate</quote> text entities are defined like:
   </para>
   <para>
    <literal>&lt;!entity supported SYSTEM "supported.sgml"&gt;</literal>
   </para>
   <para>
     In this example, the contents of the file,
     <filename>supported.sgml</filename> is available for inclusion anywhere
     in the doc. To make this happen, just reference the now defined
     entity: <literal>&#38;supported;</literal> (starts with an ampersand
     and ends with a semi-colon), and the contents will be dumped into
     the finished doc at that point.

    <sect2 id="s1"><title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This set of standards is designed to make our lives easier.  It is
    developed with the simple goal of helping us keep the "new and improved
    <application>Privoxy</application>" consistent and reliable. Thus making
    maintenance easier and increasing chances of success of the
    project.</para>

    <para>And that of course comes back to us as individuals. If we can
    increase our development and product efficiencies then we can solve more
    of the request for changes/improvements and in general feel good about
    ourselves. ;-></para>

  </sect2>

    <sect2 id="s2"><title>Using Comments</title>


    <sect3 id="s3"><title>Comment, Comment, Comment</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Comment as much as possible without commenting the obvious.
    For example do not comment "variable_a is equal to variable_b".
    Instead explain why variable_a should be equal to the variable_b.
    Just because a person can read code does not mean they will
    understand why or what is being done. A reader may spend a lot
    more time figuring out what is going on when a simple comment
    or explanation would have prevented the extra research. Please
    help your fellow Privoxy developers out!</para>

    <para>The comments will also help justify the intent of the code.
    If the comment describes something different than what the code
    is doing then maybe a programming error is occurring.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
/* if page size greater than 1k ... */
if (page_length() > 1024)
{
    ... "block" the page up ...
}

/* if page size is small, send it in blocks */
if (page_length() > 1024)
{
    ... "block" the page up ...
}

This demonstrates 2 cases of "what not to do".  The first is a
"syntax comment".  The second is a comment that does not fit what
is actually being done.
</programlisting>
  </sect3>



    <sect3 id="s4"><title>Use blocks for comments</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Comments can help or they can clutter. They help when they
    are differentiated from the code they describe. One line
    comments do not offer effective separation between the comment
    and the code. Block identifiers do, by surrounding the code
    with a clear, definable pattern.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
/*********************************************************************
 * This will stand out clearly in your code!
 *********************************************************************/
if (this_variable == that_variable)
{
   do_something_very_important();
}


/* unfortunately, this may not */
if (this_variable == that_variable)
{
   do_something_very_important();
}


if (this_variable == that_variable) /* this may not either */
{
   do_something_very_important();
}</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Exception:</emphasis></para>

    <para>If you are trying to add a small logic comment and do not
    wish to "disrupt" the flow of the code, feel free to use a 1
    line comment which is NOT on the same line as the code.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s5"><title>Keep Comments on their own line</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>It goes back to the question of readability. If the comment
    is on the same line as the code it will be harder to read than
    the comment that is on its own line.</para>

    <para>There are three exceptions to this rule, which should be
    violated freely and often: during the definition of variables,
    at the end of closing braces, when used to comment
    parameters.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
/*********************************************************************
 * This will stand out clearly in your code,
 * But the second example won't.
 *********************************************************************/
if (this_variable == this_variable)
{
   do_something_very_important();
}

if (this_variable == this_variable) /*can you see me?*/
{
   do_something_very_important(); /*not easily*/
}


/*********************************************************************
 * But, the encouraged exceptions:
 *********************************************************************/
int urls_read     = 0;     /* # of urls read + rejected */
int urls_rejected = 0;     /* # of urls rejected */

if (1 == X)
{
   do_something_very_important();
}


short do_something_very_important(
   short firstparam,   /* represents something */
   short nextparam     /* represents something else */ )
{
   ...code here...

}   /* -END- do_something_very_important */
</programlisting>
  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s6"><title>Comment each logical step</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Logical steps should be commented to help others follow the
    intent of the written code and comments will make the code more
    readable.</para>

    <para>If you have 25 lines of code without a comment, you should
    probably go back into it to see where you forgot to put
    one.</para>

    <para>Most "for", "while", "do", etc... loops _probably_ need a
    comment. After all, these are usually major logic
    containers.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s7"><title>Comment All Functions Thoroughly</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>A reader of the code should be able to look at the comments
    just prior to the beginning of a function and discern the
    reason for its existence and the consequences of using it. The
    reader should not have to read through the code to determine if
    a given function is safe for a desired use. The proper
    information thoroughly presented at the introduction of a
    function not only saves time for subsequent maintenance or
    debugging, it more importantly aids in code reuse by allowing a
    user to determine the safety and applicability of any function
    for the problem at hand. As a result of such benefits, all
    functions should contain the information presented in the
    addendum section of this document.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s8"><title>Comment at the end of braces if the
    content is more than one screen length</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Each closing brace should be followed on the same line by a
    comment that describes the origination of the brace if the
    original brace is off of the screen, or otherwise far away from
    the closing brace. This will simplify the debugging,
    maintenance, and readability of the code.</para>

    <para>As a suggestion , use the following flags to make the
    comment and its brace more readable:</para>

    <para>use following a closing brace: } /* -END- if() or while ()
    or etc... */</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
if (1 == X)
{
   do_something_very_important();
   ...some long list of commands...
} /* -END- if x is 1 */

or:

if (1 == X)
{
   do_something_very_important();
   ...some long list of commands...
} /* -END- if (1 == X) */

    <sect2 id="s9"><title>Naming Conventions</title>



    <sect3 id="s10"><title>Variable Names</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Use all lowercase, and separate words via an underscore
    ('_'). Do not start an identifier with an underscore. (ANSI C
    reserves these for use by the compiler and system headers.) Do
    not use identifiers which are reserved in ANSI C++. (E.g.
    template, class, true, false, ...). This is in case we ever
    decide to port Privoxy to C++.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
int ms_iis5_hack = 0;</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Instead of:</emphasis></para>

<programlisting>
int msiis5hack = 0; int msIis5Hack = 0;

    reserves these for use by the compiler and system headers.) Do
    not use identifiers which are reserved in ANSI C++. (E.g.
    template, class, true, false, ...). This is in case we ever
    decide to port Privoxy to C++.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
int load_some_file(struct client_state *csp)</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Instead of:</emphasis></para>

<programlisting>
int loadsomefile(struct client_state *csp)
int loadSomeFile(struct client_state *csp)
</programlisting>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s12"><title>Header file prototypes</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Use a descriptive parameter name in the function prototype
    in header files. Use the same parameter name in the header file
    that you use in the c file.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
(.h) extern int load_aclfile(struct client_state *csp);
(.c) int load_aclfile(struct client_state *csp)</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Instead of:</emphasis></para>

</programlisting>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s13"><title>Enumerations, and #defines</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Use all capital letters, with underscores between words. Do
    not start an identifier with an underscore. (ANSI C reserves
    these for use by the compiler and system headers.)</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
(enumeration) : enum Boolean {FALSE, TRUE};
(#define) : #define DEFAULT_SIZE 100;</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> We have a standard naming scheme for #defines
    that toggle a feature in the preprocessor: FEATURE_>, where
    > is a short (preferably 1 or 2 word) description.</para>

    <sect2 id="s15"><title>Using Space</title>



    <sect3 id="s16"><title>Put braces on a line by themselves.</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>The brace needs to be on a line all by itself, not at the
    end of the statement. Curly braces should line up with the
    construct that they're associated with. This practice makes it
    easier to identify the opening and closing braces for a
    block.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
if (this == that)
{
   ...
}</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Instead of:</emphasis></para>

    <para>if (this == that) { ... }</para>

    <para>or</para>

    <para>if (this == that) { ... }</para>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> In the special case that the if-statement is
    inside a loop, and it is trivial, i.e. it tests for a
    condition that is obvious from the purpose of the block,
    one-liners as above may optically preserve the loop structure
    and make it easier to read.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Status:</emphasis> developer-discretion.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example exception:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
while (more lines are read)

}
</programlisting>
  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s17"><title>ALL control statements should have a
    block</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Using braces to make a block will make your code more
    readable and less prone to error. All control statements should
    have a block defined.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
if (this == that)
{
   do_something();
   do_something_else();
}</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Instead of:</emphasis></para>

    <para>if (this == that) do_something(); do_something_else();</para>

    <para>or</para>

    <para>if (this == that) do_something();</para>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> The first example in "Instead of" will execute
    in a manner other than that which the developer desired (per
    indentation). Using code braces would have prevented this
    "feature". The "explanation" and "exception" from the point
    above also applies.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s18"><title>Do not belabor/blow-up boolean
    expressions</title>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
structure->flag = (condition);</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Instead of:</emphasis></para>

    <para>if (condition) { structure->flag = 1; } else {

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> The former is readable and concise. The later
    is wordy and inefficient. Please assume that any developer new
    to the project has at least a "good" knowledge of C/C++. (Hope
    I do not offend by that last comment ... 8-)</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s19"><title>Use white space freely because it is
    free</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Make it readable. The notable exception to using white space
    freely is listed in the next guideline.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
int first_value   = 0;
int some_value    = 0;
int another_value = 0;
int this_variable = 0;
</programlisting>
  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s20"><title>Don't use white space around structure
    operators</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>- structure pointer operator ( "->" ) - member operator (
    "." ) - functions and parentheses</para>

    <para>It is a general coding practice to put pointers, references,
    and function parentheses next to names. With spaces, the
    connection between the object and variable/function name is not
    as clear.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
a_struct->a_member;
a_struct.a_member;
function_name();</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Instead of:</emphasis> a_struct -> a_member; a_struct . a_member;

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> Use 1 blank line before the closing brace and 2
    lines afterward. This makes the end of function standout to
    the most casual viewer. Although function comments help
    separate functions, this is still a good coding practice. In
    fact, I follow these rules when using blocks in "for", "while",
    "do" loops, and long if {} statements too. After all whitespace
    is free!</para>

    <para><emphasis>Status:</emphasis> developer-discretion on the number of blank

    <sect3 id="s22"><title>Use 3 character indentions</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>If some use 8 character TABs and some use 3 character TABs,
    the code can look *very* ragged. So use 3 character indentions
    only. If you like to use TABs, pass your code through a filter

    <sect3 id="s24"><title>Initialize all variables</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Do not assume that the variables declared will not be used

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Value should be phrased as a question that would logically

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>The default return for a function is an int. To avoid
    ambiguity, create a return for a function when the return has a
    purpose, and create a void return type if the function does not
    need to return anything.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s28"><title>Minimize function calls when iterating by
    using variables</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>It is easy to write the following code, and a clear argument
    can be made that the code is easy to understand:</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
for (size_t cnt = 0; cnt &lt; block_list_length(); cnt++)
{
   ....
}</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> Unfortunately, this makes a function call for
    each and every iteration. This increases the overhead in the
    program, because the compiler has to look up the function each
    time, call it, and return a value. Depending on what occurs in
    the block_list_length() call, it might even be creating and
    destroying structures with each iteration, even though in each
    case it is comparing "cnt" to the same value, over and over.
    Remember too - even a call to block_list_length() is a function
    call, with the same overhead.</para>

    <para>Instead of using a function call during the iterations,
    assign the value to a variable, and evaluate using the
    variable.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
size_t len = block_list_length();

for (size_t cnt = 0; cnt &lt; len; cnt++)
{
   ....
}</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Exceptions:</emphasis> if the value of block_list_length()
    *may* change or could *potentially* change, then you must code the
    function call in the for/while loop.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s29"><title>Pass and Return by Const Reference</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>This allows a developer to define a const pointer and call
    your function. If your function does not have the const
    keyword, we may not be able to use your function. Consider
    strcmp, if it were defined as: extern int strcmp(char *s1,
    char *s2);</para>

    <para>I could then not use it to compare argv's in main: int
    main(int argc, const char *argv[]) { strcmp(argv[0], "privoxy");
     }</para>

    <para>Both these pointers are *const*! If the c runtime library
    maintainers do it, we should too.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s30"><title>Pass and Return by Value</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Most structures cannot fit onto a normal stack entry (i.e.
    they are not 4 bytes or less). Aka, a function declaration
    like: int load_aclfile(struct client_state csp)</para>

    <para>would not work. So, to be consistent, we should declare all
    prototypes with "pass by value": int load_aclfile(struct
    client_state *csp)</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s31"><title>Names of include files</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Your include statements should contain the file name without
    a path. The path should be listed in the Makefile, using -I as
    processor directive to search the indicated paths. An exception
    to this would be for some proprietary software that utilizes a
    partial path to distinguish their header files from system or
    other header files.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;     /* This is not a local include */
#include "config.h"       /* This IS a local include */
</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Exception:</emphasis></para>

<programlisting>
/* This is not a local include, but requires a path element. */
#include &lt;sys/fileName.h&gt;
</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> Please! do not add "-I." to the Makefile
    without a _very_ good reason. This duplicates the #include
    "file.h" behavior.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s32"><title>Provide multiple inclusion
    protection</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Prevents compiler and linker errors resulting from
    redefinition of items.</para>

    <para>Wrap each header file with the following syntax to prevent
    multiple inclusions of the file. Of course, replace PROJECT_H
    with your file name, with "." Changed to "_", and make it
    uppercase.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
#ifndef PROJECT_H_INCLUDED
#define PROJECT_H_INCLUDED
 ...
#endif /* ndef PROJECT_H_INCLUDED */
</programlisting>
  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s33"><title>Use `extern "C"` when appropriate</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>If our headers are included from C++, they must declare our
    functions as `extern "C"`. This has no cost in C, but increases
    the potential re-usability of our code.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
#ifdef __cplusplus
extern "C"
{
#endif /* def __cplusplus */

... function definitions here ...

#ifdef __cplusplus
}
#endif /* def __cplusplus */
</programlisting>
  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s34"><title>Where Possible, Use Forward Struct
    Declaration Instead of Includes</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Useful in headers that include pointers to other struct's.
    Modifications to excess header files may cause needless
    compiles.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
/*********************************************************************
 * We're avoiding an include statement here!
 *********************************************************************/
struct file_list;
extern file_list *xyz;</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> If you declare "file_list xyz;" (without the
    pointer), then including the proper header file is necessary.
    If you only want to prototype a pointer, however, the header
    file is unnecessary.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Status:</emphasis> Use with discretion.</para>


  </sect3>
  </sect2>

    <sect2 id="s35"><title>General Coding Practices</title>



    <sect3 id="s36"><title>Turn on warnings</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation</emphasis></para>

    <para>Compiler warnings are meant to help you find bugs. You
    should turn on as many as possible. With GCC, the switch is
    "-Wall". Try and fix as many warnings as possible.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s37"><title>Provide a default case for all switch
    statements</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>What you think is guaranteed is never really guaranteed. The
    value that you don't think you need to check is the one that
    someday will be passed. So, to protect yourself from the
    unknown, always have a default step in a switch statement.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
switch (hash_string(cmd))
{
   case hash_actions_file:
      ... code ...
      break;

   case hash_confdir:
      ... code ...
      break;

   default:
      log_error( ... );
      ... anomaly code goes here ...
      continue; / break; / exit( 1 ); / etc ...

} /* end switch (hash_string(cmd)) */</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> If you already have a default condition, you
    are obviously exempt from this point. Of note, most of the
    WIN32 code calls `DefWindowProc' after the switch statement.
    This API call *should* be included in a default statement.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Another Note:</emphasis> This is not so much a readability issue
    as a robust programming issue. The "anomaly code goes here" may
    be no more than a print to the STDERR stream (as in
    load_config). Or it may really be an abort condition.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Status:</emphasis> Programmer discretion is advised.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s38"><title>Try to avoid falling through cases in a
    switch statement.</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>In general, you will want to have a 'break' statement within
    each 'case' of a switch statement. This allows for the code to
    be more readable and understandable, and furthermore can
    prevent unwanted surprises if someone else later gets creative
    and moves the code around.</para>

    <para>The language allows you to plan the fall through from one
    case statement to another simply by omitting the break
    statement within the case statement. This feature does have
    benefits, but should only be used in rare cases. In general,
    use a break statement for each case statement.</para>

    <para>If you choose to allow fall through, you should comment both
    the fact of the fall through and reason why you felt it was
    necessary.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s40"><title>Don't mix size_t and other types</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>The type of size_t varies across platforms. Do not make
    assumptions about whether it is signed or unsigned, or about
    how long it is. Do not compare a size_t against another
    variable of a different type (or even against a constant)
    without casting one of the values.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s41"><title>Declare each variable and struct on its
    own line.</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>It can be tempting to declare a series of variables all on
    one line. Don't.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
long a = 0;
long b = 0;
long c = 0;</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Instead of:</emphasis></para>

    <para>long a, b, c;</para>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis> - there is more room for comments on the
    individual variables - easier to add new variables without
    messing up the original ones - when searching on a variable to
    find its type, there is less clutter to "visually"
    eliminate</para>

    <para><emphasis>Exceptions:</emphasis> when you want to declare a bunch of loop
    variables or other trivial variables; feel free to declare them
    on one line. You should, although, provide a good comment on
    their functions.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Status:</emphasis> developer-discretion.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s42"><title>Use malloc/zalloc sparingly</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>Create a local struct (on the stack) if the variable will
    live and die within the context of one function call.</para>

    <para>Only "malloc" a struct (on the heap) if the variable's life
    will extend beyond the context of one function call.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
If a function creates a struct and stores a pointer to it in a
list, then it should definitely be allocated via `malloc'.
</programlisting>
  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s43"><title>The Programmer Who Uses 'malloc' is
    Responsible for Ensuring 'free'</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>If you have to "malloc" an instance, you are responsible for
    insuring that the instance is `free'd, even if the deallocation
    event falls within some other programmer's code. You are also
    responsible for ensuring that deletion is timely (i.e. not too
    soon, not too late). This is known as "low-coupling" and is a
    "good thing (tm)". You may need to offer a
    free/unload/destructor type function to accommodate this.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Example:</emphasis></para>
<programlisting>
int load_re_filterfile(struct client_state *csp) { ... }
static void unload_re_filterfile(void *f) { ... }</programlisting>

    <para><emphasis>Exceptions:</emphasis></para>

    <para>The developer cannot be expected to provide `free'ing
    functions for C run-time library functions ... such as
    `strdup'.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Status:</emphasis> developer-discretion. The "main" use of this
    standard is for allocating and freeing data structures (complex
    or nested).</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s44"><title>Add loaders to the `file_list' structure
    and in order</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>I have ordered all of the "blocker" file code to be in alpha
    order. It is easier to add/read new blockers when you expect a
    certain order.</para>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> It may appear that the alpha order is broken in
    places by POPUP tests coming before PCRS tests. But since
    POPUPs can also be referred to as KILLPOPUPs, it is clear that
    it should come first.</para>


  </sect3>


    <sect3 id="s45"><title>"Uncertain" new code and/or changes to
    existing code, use XXX</title>

    <para><emphasis>Explanation:</emphasis></para>

    <para>If you have enough confidence in new code or confidence in
    your changes, but are not *quite* sure of the repercussions,
    add this:</para>

    <para>/* XXX: this code has a logic error on platform XYZ, *
    attempting to fix */ #ifdef PLATFORM ...changed code here...
    #endif</para>

    <para>or:</para>

    <para>/* XXX: I think the original author really meant this...
    */ ...changed code here...</para>

    <para>or:</para>

    <para>/* XXX: new code that *may* break something else... */
    ...new code here...</para>

    <para><emphasis>Note:</emphasis> If you make it clear that this may or may not
    be a "good thing (tm)", it will be easier to identify and
    include in the project (or conversely exclude from the
    project).</para>

              Y, the version minor, represents the branch within the major version.
              At any point in time, there are two branches being maintained:
              The stable branch, with an even minor, say, 2N, in which no functionality is
              being added and only bug-fixes are made, and 2N+1, the development branch, in
              which the further development of <application>Privoxy</application> takes
              place.
              This enables us to turn the code upside down and inside out, while at the same time
              providing and maintaining a stable version.
              The minor is reset to zero (and one) when the major is incremented. When a development
              branch has matured to the point where it can be turned into stable, the old stable branch
              2N is given up (i.e. no longer maintained), the former development branch 2N+1 becomes the
              new stable branch 2N+2, and a new development branch 2N+3 is opened.

              Z, the point or sub version, represents a release of the software within a branch.
              It is therefore incremented immediately after each software release.
      <!-- FIXME   this is not the way it works any more
              In development branches, only the even point versions correspond to actual releases,
              while the odd ones denote the evolving state of the sources on Git in between.
              It follows that Z is odd on Git in development branches most of the time. There, it gets
              increased to an even number immediately before a code freeze, and is increased to an odd
              number again immediately thereafter.
              This ensures that builds from Git snapshots are easily distinguished from released versions.
           didn't Fabian get rid of the even=stable, odd=dev convention for release numbering? -->
              The point version is reset to zero when the minor changes.
            </para>
            <para>
              Stable branches work a little differently, since there should be
              little to no development happening in such branches. Remember,
              only bugfixes, which presumably should have had some testing
              before being committed. Stable branches will then have their
              version reported as <literal>0.0.0</literal>, during that period
              between releases when changes are being added. This is to denote
              that this code is <emphasis>not for release</emphasis>. Then
              as the release nears, the version is bumped according: e.g.
              <literal>3.0.1 -> 0.0.0 -> 3.0.2</literal>.
            </para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
    <para>
     In summary, the main Git trunk is the development branch where new
     features are being worked on for the next stable series. This should
     almost always be where the most activity takes place. There is always at
     least one stable branch from the trunk, e.g now it is
     <literal>3.0</literal>, which is only used to release stable versions.
     Once the initial *.0 release of the stable branch has been done, then as a
     rule, only bugfixes that have had prior testing should be committed to
     the stable branch. Once there are enough bugfixes to justify a new
     release, the version of this branch is again incremented Example: 3.0.0
     -> 3.0.1 -> 3.0.2, etc are all stable releases from within the stable
     branch. 3.1.x is currently the main trunk, and where work on 3.2.x is
     taking place. If any questions, please post to the devel list
     <emphasis>before</emphasis> committing to a stable branch!
    </para>
    <para>
     Developers should remember too that if they commit a bugfix to the stable
     branch, this will more than likely require a separate submission to the
     main trunk, since these are separate development trees within Git. If you
     are working on both, then this would require at least two separate check
     outs (i.e main trunk, <emphasis>and</emphasis> the stable release branch,
     which is <literal>v_3_0_branch</literal> at the moment).
