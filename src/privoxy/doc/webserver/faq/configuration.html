      "QUOTE">"actions"</span> file?</a></h3>
      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> utilizes the concept of <span class="QUOTE">" <a href=
      "../user-manual/actions-file.html#ACTIONS" target="_top">actions</a>"</span> that are used to manipulate and
      control web page data. <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html" target="_top">Actions files</a> are where these
      <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#ACTIONS" target="_top">actions</a> that <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> could take while processing a certain request, are configured. Typically, you would
      define a set of default actions that apply globally to all URLs, then add exceptions to these defaults where
      needed. There is a wide array of actions available that give the user a high degree of control and flexibility on
      how to process each and every web page.</p>
      <p>Actions can be defined on a <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#AF-PATTERNS" target="_top">URL
      pattern</a> basis, i.e. for single URLs, whole web sites, groups or parts thereof etc. Actions can also be
      grouped together and then applied to requests matching one or more patterns. There are many possible actions that
      might apply to any given site. As an example, if you are blocking <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookie" target="_top">cookies</a> as one of your default actions, but need
      to accept cookies from a given site, you would need to define an exception for this site in one of your actions
      files, preferably in <tt class="FILENAME">user.action</tt>.</p>

      <p>Actions files are just text files in a special syntax and can be edited with a text editor. But probably the
      easiest way is to access <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>'s user interface with your web browser at
      <a href="http://config.privoxy.org/" target="_top">http://config.privoxy.org/</a> (Shortcut: <a href=

      "http://config.privoxy.org/show-status" target="_top">View &#38; change the current configuration</a>"</span>
      from the menu. Note that this feature must be explicitly enabled in the main config file (see <a href=

      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="NEWCONFIG" id="NEWCONFIG">3.6. Can I use my old config files?</a></h3>
      <p>The syntax and purpose of configuration files has remained roughly the same throughout the 3.x series, but
      backwards compatibility is not guaranteed. Also each release contains updated, <span class=
      "QUOTE">"improved"</span> versions and it is therefore strongly recommended to install the newer configuration
      files and merge back your modifications.</p>

      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="DIFFICULT" id="DIFFICULT">3.7. Why is the configuration so complicated?</a></h3>
      <p><span class="QUOTE">"Complicated"</span> is in the eye of the beholder.</p>
      <p>Privoxy is currently mainly written by and for people who are already familiar with the underlying concepts
      like regular expressions, HTTP and HTML, or are willing to become familiar with them to be able to get the most
      out of a powerful and flexible tool such as Privoxy.</p>
      <p>While everybody is expected to be able to get a Privoxy default installation up and running, fine-tuning
      requires a certain amount of background information and Privoxy's documentation mainly concentrates on the
      Privoxy-specific parts while only providing references to the rest.</p>

      <p>The default configuration shouldn't impact the usability of any of these services. It may, however, make all
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookie" target="_top">cookies</a> temporary, so that your browser
      will forget your login credentials in between browser sessions. If you would like not to have to log in manually
      each time you access those websites, simply turn off all cookie handling for them in the <tt class=
      "FILENAME">user.action</tt> file. An example for yahoo might look like:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>

      <p>These kinds of sites are often quite complex and heavy with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript"
      target="_top">Javascript</a> and thus <span class="QUOTE">"fragile"</span>. So if <span class=
      "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">still</i></span> a problem, we have an <a href=

      <p>Be sure to flush your browser's caches whenever making these kinds of changes, just to make sure the changes
      <span class="QUOTE">"take"</span>.</p>
      <p>Make sure the domain, host and path are appropriate as well. Your browser can tell you where you are

      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="CONFIGFILES" id="CONFIGFILES">3.9. What's the difference between the <span class=
      "QUOTE">"Cautious"</span>, <span class="QUOTE">"Medium"</span> and <span class="QUOTE">"Advanced"</span>
      defaults?</a></h3>
      <p>Configuring <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is not entirely trivial. To help you get started, we
      provide you with three different default action <span class="QUOTE">"profiles"</span> in the web based actions
      file editor at <a href="http://config.privoxy.org/show-status" target=
      "_top">http://config.privoxy.org/show-status</a>. See the <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html" target=
      "_top"><i class="CITETITLE">User Manual</i></a> for a list of actions, and how the default profiles are set.</p>
      <p>Where the defaults are likely to break some sites, exceptions for known popular <span class=
      "QUOTE">"problem"</span> sites are included, but in general, the more aggressive your default settings are, the
      more exceptions you will have to make later. New users are best to start off in <span class=
      "QUOTE">"Cautious"</span> setting. This is safest and will have the fewest problems. See the <a href=
      "../user-manual/index.html" target="_top"><i class="CITETITLE">User Manual</i></a> for a more detailed
      discussion.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that the <span class="QUOTE">"Advanced"</span> profile (formerly known as the <span class=
      "QUOTE">"Adventuresome"</span> profile) is more aggressive, and will make use of some of <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> advanced features. Use at your own risk!</p>

      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="BROWSECONFIG" id="BROWSECONFIG">3.10. Why can I change the configuration with a
      browser? Does that not raise security issues?</a></h3>
      <p>It may seem strange that regular users can edit the config files with their browsers, although the whole
      <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/privoxy</tt> hierarchy belongs to the user <span class="QUOTE">"privoxy"</span>, with
      only 644 permissions.</p>
      <p>When you use the browser-based editor, <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> itself is writing to the
      config files. Because <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is running as the user <span class=
      "QUOTE">"privoxy"</span>, it can update its own config files.</p>
      <p>If you run <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> for multiple untrusted users (e.g. in a LAN) or aren't
      entirely in control of your own browser, you will probably want to make sure that the web-based editor and remote
      toggle features are <span class="QUOTE">"off"</span> by setting <span class="QUOTE">"<tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
      "../user-manual/config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS" target="_top">enable-edit-actions</a> 0</tt>"</span> and
      <span class="QUOTE">"<tt class="LITERAL"><a href="../user-manual/config.html#ENABLE-REMOTE-TOGGLE" target=

      <p>As of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> 3.0.7 these options are disabled by default.</p>

      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="FILTERFILE" id="FILTERFILE">3.11. What is the <tt class="FILENAME">default.filter</tt>
      file? What is a <span class="QUOTE">"filter"</span>?</a></h3>
      <p>The <a href="../user-manual/filter-file.html" target="_top"><tt class="FILENAME">default.filter</tt></a> file
      is where <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">filters</i></span> as supplied by the developers are defined.
      Filters are a special subset of actions that can be used to modify or remove web page content or headers on the
      fly. Content filters can be applied to <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">anything</i></span> in the page
      source, header filters can be applied to either server or client headers. Regular expressions are used to
      accomplish this.</p>
      <p>There are a number of pre-defined filters to deal with common annoyances. The filters are only defined here,
      to invoke them, you need to use the <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#FILTER" target="_top"><tt class=
      "LITERAL">filter</tt> action</a> in one of the actions files. Content filtering is automatically disabled for
      inappropriate MIME types, but if you know better than Privoxy what should or should not be filtered you can
      filter any content you like.</p>
      <p>Filters should <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span> be confused with <a href=
      "../user-manual/actions-file.html#BLOCK" target="_top"><tt class="LITERAL">blocks</tt></a>, which is a completely
      different action, and is more typically used to block ads and unwanted sites.</p>
      <p>If you are familiar with regular expressions, and HTML, you can look at the provided <tt class=
      "FILENAME">default.filter</tt> with a text editor and define your own filters. This is potentially a very
      powerful feature, but requires some expertise in both regular expressions and HTML/HTTP. You should place any
      modifications to the default filters, or any new ones you create in a separate file, such as <tt class=
      "FILENAME">user.filter</tt>, so they won't be overwritten during upgrades. The ability to define multiple filter
      files in <tt class="FILENAME">config</tt> is a new feature as of v. 3.0.5.</p>
      <p>There is no GUI editor option for this part of the configuration, but you can disable/enable the various
      pre-defined filters of the included <tt class="FILENAME">default.filter</tt> file with the <a href=
      "http://config.privoxy.org/show-status" target="_top">web-based actions file editor</a>. Note that the custom
      actions editor must be explicitly enabled in the main config file (see <a href=
      "../user-manual/config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS" target="_top">enable-edit-actions</a>).</p>
      <p>If you intend to develop your own filters, you might want to have a look at <a href=

      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="LANCONFIG" id="LANCONFIG">3.12. How can I set up Privoxy to act as a proxy for my
      LAN?</a></h3>
      <p>By default, <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> only responds to requests from <tt class=
      "LITERAL">127.0.0.1</tt> (localhost). To have it act as a server for a network, this needs to be changed in the
      <a href="../user-manual/config.html" target="_top">main configuration file</a>. Look for the <tt class=
      "LITERAL"><a href="../user-manual/config.html#LISTEN-ADDRESS" target="_top">listen-address</a></tt> option, which
      may be commented out with a <span class="QUOTE">"#"</span> symbol. Make sure it is uncommented, and assign it the
      address of the LAN gateway interface, and port number to use. Assuming your LAN address is 192.168.1.1 and you
      wish to run <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> on port 8118, this line should look like:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>

      </table>
      <p>Save the file, and restart <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>. Configure all browsers on the network
      then to use this address and port number.</p>
      <p>Alternately, you can have <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> listen on all available interfaces:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN">  listen-address    :8118</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>And then use <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> <a href="../user-manual/config.html#PERMIT-ACCESS"
      target="_top">permit-access</a> feature to limit connections. A firewall in this situation is recommended as
      well.</p>
      <p>The above steps should be the same for any TCP network, regardless of operating system.</p>
      <p>If you run <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> on a LAN with untrusted users, we recommend that you
      double-check the <a href="../user-manual/config.html#ACCESS-CONTROL" target="_top">access control and

      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="WHYSEEUM" id="WHYSEEUM">3.14. Why would anybody want to see a checkerboard
      pattern?</a></h3>
      <p>Remember that <a href="general.html#WHATSANAD">telling which image is an ad and which isn't</a>, is an
      educated guess. While we hope that the standard configuration is rather smart, it will make occasional mistakes.
      The checkerboard image is visually decent, and it shows you where images have been blocked, which can be very
      helpful in case some navigation aid or otherwise innocent image was erroneously blocked. It is recommended for
      new users so they can <span class="QUOTE">"see"</span> what is happening. Some people might also enjoy seeing how
      many banners they <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">don't</i></span> have to see.</p>

      instead of the checkerboard image. Why and how do I get rid of this?</a></h3>
      <p>This happens when the banners are not embedded in the HTML code of the page itself, but in separate HTML
      (sub)documents that are loaded into (i)frames or (i)layers, and these external HTML documents are blocked. Being
      non-images they get replaced by a substitute HTML page rather than a substitute image, which wouldn't work out
      technically, since the browser expects and accepts only HTML when it has requested an HTML document.</p>
      <p>The substitute page adapts to the available space and shows itself as a miniature two-liner if loaded into
      small frames, or full-blown with a large red "BLOCKED" banner if space allows.</p>
      <p>If you prefer the banners to be blocked by images, you must see to it that the HTML documents in which they
      are embedded are not blocked. Clicking the <span class="QUOTE">"See why"</span> link offered in the substitute
      page will show you which rule blocked the page. After changing the rule and un-blocking the HTML documents, the
      browser will try to load the actual banner images and the usual image blocking will (hopefully!) kick in.</p>

      <p>This can be done and is often useful to combine the benefits of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> with

      <p>No, its more complicated than that. This only works with special kinds of proxies known as <span class=

      <p>The whole idea of Privoxy is to modify client requests and server responses in all sorts of ways and therefore
      it's not a transparent proxy as described in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616" target="_top">RFC
      2616</a>.</p>
      <p>However, some people say <span class="QUOTE">"transparent proxy"</span> when they mean <span class=

      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> can't intercept traffic itself, but it can handle requests that where
      intercepted and redirected with a packet filter (like <span class="APPLICATION">PF</span> or <span class=

      <p>As the <tt class="LITERAL">Host</tt> header is required by HTTP/1.1 and as most web sites rely on it anyway,
      this limitation shouldn't be a problem.</p>
      <p>Please refer to your packet filter's documentation to learn how to intercept and redirect traffic into
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>. Afterward you just have to configure <span class=

      <p>Versions of <span class="APPLICATION">Outlook</span> prior to Office 2007, use <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Internet Explorer</span> components to both render HTML, and fetch any HTTP requests that may be
      embedded in an HTML email. So however you have <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> configured to work with
      IE, this configuration should automatically be shared, at least with older version of Internet Explorer.</p>
      <p>Starting with Office 2007, Microsoft is instead using the MS-Word rendering engine with Outlook. It is unknown
      whether this can be configured to use a proxy.</p>

      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="OUTLOOK-MORE" id="OUTLOOK-MORE">3.22. How can I have separate rules just for HTML
      mail?</a></h3>
      <p>The short answer is, you can't. <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> has no way of knowing which
      particular application makes a request, so there is no way to distinguish between web pages and HTML mail.
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> just blindly proxies all requests. In the case of <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Outlook Express</span> (see above), OE uses IE anyway, and there is no way for <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> to ever be able to distinguish between them (nor could any other proxy type
      application for that matter).</p>

      How?</a></h3>
      <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookie" target="_top">Cookies</a> can be set in several ways.
      The classic method is via the <tt class="LITERAL">Set-Cookie</tt> HTTP header. This is straightforward, and an
      easy one to manipulate, such as the <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> concept of <a href=
      "../user-manual/actions-file.html#SESSION-COOKIES-ONLY" target="_top">session-cookies-only</a>. There is also the
      possibility of using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript" target="_top">Javascript</a> to set
      cookies (<span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> calls these <tt class="LITERAL">content-cookies</tt>). This is
      trickier because the syntax can vary widely, and thus requires a certain amount of guesswork. It is not realistic
      to catch all of these short of disabling Javascript, which would break many sites. And lastly, if the cookies are
      embedded in a HTTPS/SSL secure session via Javascript, they are beyond <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span>
      reach.</p>
      <p>All in all, <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> can help manage cookies in general, can help minimize the
      loss of privacy posed by cookies, but can't realistically stop all cookies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="EVIL-COOKIES" id="EVIL-COOKIES">3.24. Are all cookies bad? Why?</a></h3>
      <p>No, in fact there are many beneficial uses of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookie" target=
      "_top">cookies</a>. Cookies are just a method that browsers can use to store data between pages, or between
      browser sessions. Sometimes there is a good reason for this, and the user's life is a bit easier as a result. But
      there is a long history of some websites taking advantage of this layer of trust, and using the data they glean
      from you and your browsing habits for their own purposes, and maybe to your potential detriment. Such sites are
      using you and storing their data on your system. That is why the privacy conscious watch from whom those cookies
      come, and why they really <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">need</i></span> to be there.</p>
      <p>See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookie" target="_top">Wikipedia cookie definition</a>
      for more.</p>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="ALLOW-COOKIES" id="ALLOW-COOKIES">3.25. How can I allow permanent cookies for my
      trusted sites?</a></h3>
      <p>There are several actions that relate to cookies. The default behavior is to allow only <span class=
      "QUOTE">"session cookies"</span>, which means the cookies only last for the current browser session. This
      eliminates most kinds of abuse related to cookies. But there may be cases where you want cookies to last.</p>
      <p>To disable all cookie actions, so that cookies are allowed unrestricted, both in and out, for <tt class=
      "LITERAL">example.com</tt>:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class=

  .example.com</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Place the above in <tt class="FILENAME">user.action</tt>. Note that some of these may be off by default
      anyway, so this might be redundant, but there is no harm being explicit in what you want to happen. <tt class=
      "FILENAME">user.action</tt> includes an alias for this situation, called <tt class=
      "LITERAL">allow-all-cookies</tt>.</p>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="MULTIPLES" id="MULTIPLES">3.26. Can I have separate configurations for different
      users?</a></h3>
      <p>Each instance of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> has its own configuration, including such attributes
      as the TCP port that it listens on. What you can do is run multiple instances of <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>, each with a unique <a href="../user-manual/config.html#LISTEN-ADDRESS" target=
      "_top">listen-address</a> configuration setting, and configuration path, and then each of these can have their
      own configurations. Think of it as per-port configuration.</p>
      <p>Simple enough for a few users, but for large installations, consider having groups of users that might share
      like configurations.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="WHITELISTS" id="WHITELISTS">3.27. Can I set-up Privoxy as a whitelist of <span class=
      "QUOTE">"good"</span> sites?</a></h3>
      <p>Sure. There are a couple of things you can do for simple white-listing. Here's one real easy one:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN"> ############################################################
 # Blacklist
 ############################################################
 { <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#BLOCK" target="_top">+block</a> }
 / # Block *all* URLs

 ############################################################
 # Whitelist
 ############################################################
 { <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#BLOCK" target="_top">-block</a> }
  kids.example.com
  toys.example.com
  games.example.com</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This allows access to only those three sites by first blocking all URLs, and then subsequently allowing three
      specific exceptions.</p>
      <p>Another approach is <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> <tt class="LITERAL">trustfile</tt> concept,
      which incorporates the notion of <span class="QUOTE">"trusted referrers"</span>. See the <a href=
      "../user-manual/config.html#TRUSTFILE" target="_top">Trust documentation</a> for details.</p>
      <p>These are fairly simple approaches and are not completely foolproof. There are various other configuration
      options that should be disabled (described elsewhere here and in <a href="../user-manual/" target="_top">the User
      Manual</a>) so that users can't modify their own configuration and easily circumvent the whitelist.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="NO-ADBLOCK" id="NO-ADBLOCK">3.28. How can I turn off ad-blocking?</a></h3>
      <p>Ad blocking is achieved through a complex application of various <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>
      <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html" target="_top">actions</a>. These actions are deployed against simple
      images, banners, flash animations, text pages, JavaScript, pop-ups and pop-unders, etc., so its not as simple as
      just turning one or two actions off. The various actions that make up <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> ad
      blocking are hard-coded into the default configuration files. It has been assumed that everyone using
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is interested in this particular feature.</p>
      <p>If you want to do without this, there are several approaches you can take: You can manually undo the many
      block rules in <tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt>. Or even easier, just create your own <tt class=
      "FILENAME">default.action</tt> file from scratch without the many ad blocking rules, and corresponding
      exceptions. Or lastly, if you are not concerned about the additional blocks that are done for privacy reasons,
      you can very easily over-ride <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">all</i></span> blocking with the
      following very simple rule in your <tt class="FILENAME">user.action</tt>:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN"> # Unblock everybody, everywhere
 { <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#BLOCK" target="_top">-block</a> }
 / # UN-Block *all* URLs</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Or even a more comprehensive reversing of various ad related actions:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN"> # Unblock everybody, everywhere, and turn off appropriate filtering, etc
 { <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#BLOCK" target="_top">-block</a> \
  <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#FILTER-BANNERS-BY-SIZE" target="_top">-filter{banners-by-size}</a> \
  <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#FILTER-BANNERS-BY-LINK" target="_top">-filter{banners-by-link}</a> \
  <tt class="LITERAL">allow-popups</tt> \
 }
 / # UN-Block *all* URLs and allow ads</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This last <span class="QUOTE">"action"</span> in this compound statement, <tt class=
      "LITERAL">allow-popups</tt>, is an <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#ALIASES" target="_top">alias</a>

      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> <span class="QUOTE">"templates"</span> are specialized text files
      utilized by <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> for various purposes and can easily be modified using any

      "FILENAME">templates</tt>. Knowing something about HTML syntax will of course be helpful.</p>
      <p>Be forewarned that the default templates are subject to being overwritten during upgrades. You can, however,
      create completely new templates, place them in another directory and specify the alternate path in the main
      <tt class="FILENAME">config</tt>. For details, have a look at the <a href="../user-manual/config.html#TEMPLDIR"

      <p>There is more than one way to do it (although Perl is not involved).</p>
      <p>Editing the BLOCKED template page (see above) may dissuade some users, but this method is easily circumvented.
      Where you need this level of control, you might want to build <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> from
      source, and disable various features that are available as compile-time options. You should <b class=
      "COMMAND">configure</b> the sources as follows:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN"> ./configure  --disable-toggle  --disable-editor  --disable-force</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This will create an executable with hard-coded security features so that <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> does not allow easy bypassing of blocked sites, or changing the current
      configuration via any connected user's web browser.</p>
      <p>Finally, all of these features can also be toggled on/off via options in <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> main <a href="../user-manual/config.html#ACCESS-CONTROL" target="_top">config</a>
      file which means you don't have to recompile anything.</p>
