      <p>A long time ago, there was the <span class="APPLICATION">Internet Junkbuster</span>, by Anonymous Coders and
      Junkbusters Corporation. This saved many users a lot of pain in the early days of web advertising and user
      tracking.</p>
      <p>But the web, its protocols and standards, and with it, the techniques for forcing ads on users, give up
      autonomy over their browsing, and for tracking them, keeps evolving. Unfortunately, the <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Internet Junkbuster</span> did not. Version 2.0.2, published in 1998, was the last official
      release, available from Junkbusters Corporation. Fortunately, it had been released under the GNU <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_top">GPL</a>, which allowed further development
      by others.</p>
      <p>So Stefan Waldherr started maintaining an improved version of the software, to which eventually a number of
      people contributed patches. It could already replace banners with a transparent image, and had a first version of
      pop-up killing, but it was still very closely based on the original, with all its limitations, such as the lack
      of HTTP/1.1 support, flexible per-site configuration, or content modification. The last release from this effort
      was version 2.0.2-10, published in 2000.</p>
      <p>Then, some <a href="https://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/copyright.html#AUTHORS" target="_top">developers</a>
      picked up the thread, and started turning the software inside out, upside down, and then reassembled it, adding
      many <a href="https://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/introduction.html#FEATURES" target="_top">new features</a>
      along the way.</p>
      <p>The result of this is <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>, whose first stable version, 3.0, was released
      August, 2002.</p>
      <p>As of 2012 the Junkbusters Corporation's website (http://www.junkbusters.com/) has been shut down, but Privoxy
      is still actively maintained.</p>
