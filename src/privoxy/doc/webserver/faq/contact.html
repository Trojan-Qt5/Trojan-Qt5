    <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="CONTACT" id="CONTACT">6. Contacting the developers, Bug Reporting and Feature
    Requests</a></h1>
    <p>We value your feedback. In fact, we rely on it to improve <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> and its
    configuration. However, please note the following hints, so we can provide you with the best support.</p>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="SUFFICIENT-INFORMATION" id="SUFFICIENT-INFORMATION">6.1. Please provide sufficient
      information</a></h2>
      <p>A lot of support requests don't contain enough information and can't be solved without a lot of back and forth
      which causes unnecessary delays. Reading this section should help to prevent that.</p>
      <p>Before contacting us to report a problem, please try to verify that it is a <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> problem, and not a browser or site problem or documented behaviour that just happens
      to be different than what you expected. If unsure, try <a href="http://config.privoxy.org/toggle?set=disable"
      target="_top">toggling off</a> <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>, and see if the problem persists.</p>
      <p>If you are using your own custom configuration, please try the default configuration to see if the problem is
      configuration related. If you're having problems with a feature that is disabled by default, please ask around on
      the mailing list if others can reproduce the problem.</p>
      <p>If you aren't using the latest Privoxy version, the problem may have been found and fixed in the meantime. We
      would appreciate if you could take the time to <a href="https://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/installation.html"
      target="_top">upgrade to the latest version</a> and verify that the problem still exists.</p>
      <p>Please be sure to provide the following information when reporting problems or requesting support:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The exact <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> version you are using.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The operating system and versions you run <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> on, e.g. <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Windows XP SP2</span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The name, platform, and version of the <span class="APPLICATION">browser</span> you were using (e.g.
          <span class="APPLICATION">Internet Explorer v5.5</span> for Mac).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The URL where the problem occurred, or some way for us to duplicate the problem (e.g. <tt class=
          "LITERAL">http://somesite.example.com/?somethingelse=123</tt>).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Whether your version of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is one supplied by the <span class=
          "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> developers via SourceForge, or if you got your copy somewhere else.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Whether you are using <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> together with another proxy such as
          <span class="APPLICATION">Tor</span>. If so, please temporary disable the other proxy to see if the symptoms
          change.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Whether you are using a personal firewall product. If so, does <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>
          work without it?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Any other pertinent information to help identify the problem such as config or log file excerpts (yes, you
          should have log file entries for each action taken). To get a meaningful logfile, please make sure that the
          <a href="../user-manual/config.html#LOGFILE" target="_top">logfile directive</a> is being used and the
          following <a href="../user-manual/config.html#DEBUG" target="_top">debug options</a> are enabled (all of
          them):</p>
          <p class="LITERALLAYOUT">

          debug&nbsp;32768&nbsp;#&nbsp;log&nbsp;all&nbsp;data&nbsp;read&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;network</p>
          <p>It's easy for us to ignore log messages that aren't relevant but missing log messages may make it
          impossible to investigate a problem. If you aren't sure which of the debug directives are relevant, please
          just enable all of them and let us worry about it.</p>
          <p>Note that Privoxy log files may contain sensitive information so please don't submit any logfiles you
          didn't read first. You can mask sensitive information as long as it's clear that you removed something.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You don't have to tell us your actual name when filing a problem report, but if you don't, please use a
      nickname so we can differentiate between your messages and the ones entered by other "anonymous" users that may
      respond to your request if they have the same problem or already found a solution. Note that due to spam the
      trackers may not always allow to post without being logged into SourceForge. If that's the case, you are still
      free to create a login that isn't directly linked to your name, though.</p>
      <p>Please also check the status of your request a few days after submitting it, as we may request additional
      information. If you use a SF id, you should automatically get a mail when someone responds to your request.
      Please don't bother to add an email address when using the tracker. If you prefer to communicate through email,
      just use one of the mailing lists directly.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/appendix.html#ACTIONSANAT" target="_top">appendix of the
      Privoxy User Manual</a> also has helpful information on understanding <tt class="LITERAL">actions</tt>, and

      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="CONTACT-SUPPORT" id="CONTACT-SUPPORT">6.2. Get Support</a></h2>
      <p>All users are welcome to discuss their issues on the <a href=
      "https://lists.privoxy.org/mailman/listinfo/privoxy-users" target="_top">users mailing list</a>, where the
      developers also hang around.</p>
      <p>Please don't send private support requests to individual Privoxy developers, either use the mailing lists or
      the support trackers.</p>
      <p>If you have to contact a Privoxy developer directly for other reasons, please send a real mail and do not
      bother with SourceForge's messaging system. Answers to SourceForge messages are usually bounced by SourceForge's
      mail server in which case the developer wasted time writing a response you don't get. From your point of view it
      will look like your message has been completely ignored, so this is frustrating for all parties involved.</p>
      <p>Note that the Privoxy mailing lists are moderated. Posts from unsubscribed addresses have to be accepted
      manually by a moderator. This may cause a delay of several days and if you use a subject that doesn't clearly
      mention Privoxy or one of its features, your message may be accidentally discarded as spam.</p>
      <p>If you aren't subscribed, you should therefore spend a few seconds to come up with a proper subject.
      Additionally you should make it clear that you want to get CC'd. Otherwise some responses will be directed to the
      mailing list only, and you won't see them.</p>
