      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="WHO-USES" id="WHO-USES">1.1. Who should give <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>
      a try?</a></h3>
      <p>Anyone who is interested in security, privacy, or in finer-grained control over their web and Internet
      experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="BESTCHOICE" id="BESTCHOICE">1.2. Is Privoxy the best choice for me?</a></h3>
      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is certainly a good choice, especially for those who want more
      control and security. Those with the willingness to read the documentation and the ability to fine-tune their
      installation will benefit the most.</p>
      <p>One of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> strengths is that it is highly configurable giving you the
      ability to completely personalize your installation. Being familiar with, or at least having an interest in
      learning about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Http" target="_top">HTTP</a> and other networking protocols,
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html" target="_top">HTML</a>, and <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions" target="_top"><span class="QUOTE">"Regular
      Expressions"</span></a> will be a big plus and will help you get the most out of <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>. A new installation just includes a very basic configuration. The user should take
      this as a starting point only, and enhance it as he or she sees fit. In fact, the user is encouraged, and
      expected to, fine-tune the configuration.</p>
      <p>Much of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> configuration can be done with a <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser" target="_top">Web browser</a>. But there are areas where configuration
      is done using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editors" target="_top">text editor</a> to edit
      configuration files. Also note that the web-based action editor doesn't use authentication and should only be
      enabled in environments where all clients with access to <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> listening port
      can be trusted.</p>

      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="PROXYMORON" id="PROXYMORON">1.3. What is a <span class="QUOTE">"proxy"</span>? How
      does Privoxy work?</a></h3>
      <p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server" target="_top">web proxy</a> is a service, based on a
      software such as <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>, that clients (i.e. browsers) can use instead of
      connecting to web servers directly. The clients then ask the proxy to request objects (web pages, images, movies
      etc) on their behalf and to forward the data to the clients. It is a <span class="QUOTE">"go-between"</span>. For
      details, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server" target="_top">Wikipedia's proxy
      definition</a>.</p>
      <p>There are many reasons to use web proxies, such as security (firewalling), efficiency (caching) and others,
      and there are any number of proxies to accommodate those needs.</p>
      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is a proxy that is primarily focused on privacy enhancement, ad and
      junk elimination and freeing the user from restrictions placed on his activities. Sitting between your browser(s)
      and the Internet, it is in a perfect position to filter outbound personal information that your browser is
      leaking, as well as inbound junk. It uses a variety of techniques to do this, all of which are under your
      complete control via the various configuration files and options. Being a proxy also makes it easier to share
      configurations among multiple browsers and/or users.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="OTHERSTUFF" id="OTHERSTUFF">1.4. Does Privoxy do anything more than ad
      blocking?</a></h3>
      <p>Yes, ad blocking is but one possible use. There are many, many ways <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>
      can be used to sanitize and customize web browsing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="NEWJB" id="NEWJB">1.5. What is this new version of <span class=
      "QUOTE">"Junkbuster"</span>?</a></h3>
      <p>A long time ago, there was the <span class="APPLICATION">Internet Junkbuster</span>, by Anonymous Coders and
      Junkbusters Corporation. This saved many users a lot of pain in the early days of web advertising and user
      tracking.</p>
      <p>But the web, its protocols and standards, and with it, the techniques for forcing ads on users, give up
      autonomy over their browsing, and for tracking them, keeps evolving. Unfortunately, the <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Internet Junkbuster</span> did not. Version 2.0.2, published in 1998, was the last official
      release, available from Junkbusters Corporation. Fortunately, it had been released under the GNU <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_top">GPL</a>, which allowed further development
      by others.</p>
      <p>So Stefan Waldherr started maintaining an improved version of the software, to which eventually a number of
      people contributed patches. It could already replace banners with a transparent image, and had a first version of
      pop-up killing, but it was still very closely based on the original, with all its limitations, such as the lack
      of HTTP/1.1 support, flexible per-site configuration, or content modification. The last release from this effort
      was version 2.0.2-10, published in 2000.</p>
      <p>Then, some <a href="https://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/copyright.html#AUTHORS" target="_top">developers</a>
      picked up the thread, and started turning the software inside out, upside down, and then reassembled it, adding
      many <a href="https://www.privoxy.org/user-manual/introduction.html#FEATURES" target="_top">new features</a>
      along the way.</p>
      <p>The result of this is <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>, whose first stable version, 3.0, was released
      August, 2002.</p>
      <p>As of 2012 the Junkbusters Corporation's website (http://www.junkbusters.com/) has been shut down, but Privoxy
      is still actively maintained.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="WHYPRIVOXY" id="WHYPRIVOXY">1.6. Why <span class="QUOTE">"Privoxy"</span>? Why change
      the name from Junkbuster at all?</a></h3>
      <p>Though outdated, Junkbusters Corporation continued to offer their original version of the <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Internet Junkbuster</span> for a while, so publishing our <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Junkbuster</span>-derived software under the same name would have led to confusion.</p>
      <p>There were also potential legal reasons not to use the <span class="APPLICATION">Junkbuster</span> name, as it
      was (and maybe still is) a registered trademark of Junkbusters Corporation. There were, however, no objections
      from Junkbusters Corporation to the <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> project itself, and they, in fact,
      shared our ideals and goals.</p>
      <p>The Privoxy developers also believed that there were so many improvements over the original code, that it was
      time to make a clean break from the past and make a name in their own right.</p>
      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is the <span class="QUOTE">"<span class="emphasis"><i class=
      "EMPHASIS">Privacy Enhancing Proxy</i></span>"</span>. Also, its content modification and junk suppression gives
      <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">you</i></span>, the user, more control, more freedom, and allows you
      to browse your personal and <span class="QUOTE">"<span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">private</i></span>
      edition"</span> of the web.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="DIFFERS" id="DIFFERS">1.7. How does Privoxy differ from the old Junkbuster?</a></h3>
      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> picks up where <span class="APPLICATION">Junkbuster</span> left off.
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> still blocks ads and banners, still manages <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_cookie" target="_top">cookies</a>, and still helps protect your privacy.
      But, most of these features have been enhanced, and many new ones have been added, all in the same vein.</p>
      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>'s new features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Supports "Connection: keep-alive". Outgoing connections can be kept alive independently from the
          client.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Supports IPv6, provided the operating system does so too, and the configure script detects it.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Supports tagging which allows to change the behaviour based on client and server headers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Can be run as an "intercepting" proxy, which obviates the need to configure browsers individually.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Sophisticated actions and filters for manipulating both server and client headers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Can be chained with other proxies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Integrated browser-based configuration and control utility at <a href="http://config.privoxy.org/" target=
          "_top">http://config.privoxy.org/</a> (shortcut: <a href="http://p.p/" target="_top">http://p.p/</a>).
          Browser-based tracing of rule and filter effects. Remote toggling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Web page filtering (text replacements, removes banners based on size, invisible <span class=
          "QUOTE">"web-bugs"</span> and HTML annoyances, etc.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Modularized configuration that allows for standard settings and user settings to reside in separate files,
          so that installing updated actions files won't overwrite individual user settings.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Support for Perl Compatible Regular Expressions in the configuration files, and a more sophisticated and
          flexible configuration syntax.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>GIF de-animation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Bypass many click-tracking scripts (avoids script redirection).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>User-customizable HTML templates for most proxy-generated pages (e.g. "blocked" page).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Auto-detection and re-reading of config file changes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Most features are controllable on a per-site or per-location basis.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Many smaller new features added, limitations and bugs removed.</p>
        </li>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="WHATSANAD" id="WHATSANAD">1.8. How does Privoxy know what is an ad, and what is
      not?</a></h3>
      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>'s approach to blocking ads is twofold:</p>
      <p>First, there are certain patterns in the <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">locations</i></span>
      (URLs) of banner images. This applies to both the path (you wouldn't guess how many web sites serve their banners
      from a directory called <span class="QUOTE">"banners"</span>!) and the host (blocking the big banner hosting
      services like doublecklick.net already helps a lot). <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> takes advantage of
      this fact by using <a href="../user-manual/actions-file.html#AF-PATTERNS" target="_top">URL patterns</a> to sort
      out and block the requests for things that sound like they would be ads or banners.</p>
      <p>Second, banners tend to come in certain <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">sizes</i></span>. But you
      can't tell the size of an image by its URL without downloading it, and if you do, it's too late to save
      bandwidth. Therefore, <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> also inspects the HTML sources of web pages while
      they are loaded, and replaces references to images with standard banner sizes by dummy references, so that your
      browser doesn't request them anymore in the first place.</p>
      <p>Both of this involves a certain amount of guesswork and is, of course, freely and readily configurable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="MISTAKES" id="MISTAKES">1.9. Can Privoxy make mistakes? This does not sound very
      scientific.</a></h3>
      <p>Actually, it's a black art ;-) And yes, it is always possible to have a broad rule accidentally block or
      change something by mistake. You will almost surely run into such situations at some point. It is tricky writing
      rules to cover every conceivable possibility, and not occasionally get false positives.</p>
      <p>But this should not be a big concern since the <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> configuration is very
      flexible, and includes tools to help identify these types of situations so they can be addressed as needed,
      allowing you to customize your installation. (<a href="trouble.html#BADSITE">See the Troubleshooting section
      below</a>.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="CONFIGORNOT" id="CONFIGORNOT">1.10. Will I have to configure Privoxy before I can use
      it?</a></h3>
      <p>That depends on your expectations. The default installation should give you a good starting point, and block
      <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">most</i></span> ads and unwanted content, but many of the more
      advanced features are off by default, and require you to activate them.</p>
      <p>You do have to set up your browser to use <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> (see the <a href=
      "installation.html#FIRSTSTEP">Installation section below</a>).</p>
      <p>And you will certainly run into situations where there are false positives, or ads not being blocked that you
      may not want to see. In these cases, you would certainly benefit by customizing <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> configuration to more closely match your individual situation. And we encourage
      you to do this. This is where the real power of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> lies!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="LAN" id="LAN">1.11. Can Privoxy run as a server on a network?</a></h3>
      <p>Yes, <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> runs as a server already, and can easily be configured to
      <span class="QUOTE">"serve"</span> more than one client. See <a href="configuration.html#LANCONFIG">How can I set
      up Privoxy to act as a proxy for my LAN</a> below.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="BROWSERS2" id="BROWSERS2">1.12. My browser does the same things as Privoxy. Why should
      I use Privoxy at all?</a></h3>
      <p>Modern browsers do indeed have <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">some</i></span> of the same
      functionality as <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>. Maybe this is adequate for you. But <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is very versatile and powerful, and can probably do a number of things your browser
      just can't.</p>
      <p>In addition, a proxy is good choice if you use multiple browsers, or have a LAN with multiple computers since
      <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> can run as a server application. This way all the configuration is in
      one place, and you don't have to maintain a similar configuration for possibly many browsers or users.</p>
      <p>Note, however, that it's recommended to leverage both your browser's and <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> privacy enhancing features at the same time. While your browser probably lacks
      some features <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> offers, it should also be able to do some things more
      reliably, for example restricting and suppressing JavaScript.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="WHYTRUST" id="WHYTRUST">1.13. Why should I trust Privoxy?</a></h3>
      <p>The most important reason is because you have access to <span class="emphasis"><i class=
      "EMPHASIS">everything</i></span>, and you can control everything. You can check every line of every configuration
      file yourself. You can check every last bit of source code should you desire. And even if you can't read code,
      there should be some comfort in knowing that other people can, and do read it. You can build the software from
      scratch, if you want, so that you know the executable is clean, and that it is <span class="emphasis"><i class=
      "EMPHASIS">yours</i></span>. In fact, we encourage this level of scrutiny. It is one reason we use <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> ourselves.</p>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="LICENSE" id="LICENSE">1.14. Is there is a license or fee? What about a warranty?

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="SPYWARE" id="SPYWARE">1.15. Can Privoxy remove spyware? Adware? Viruses?</a></h3>
      <p>No, at least not reliably enough to trust it. <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is not designed to be a
      malware removal tool and the default configuration doesn't even try to filter out any malware.</p>
      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> could help prevent contact from (known) sites that use such tactics
      with appropriate configuration rules, and thus could conceivably prevent contamination from such sites. However,
      keeping such a configuration up to date would require a lot of time and effort that would be better spend on
      keeping your software itself up to date so it doesn't have known vulnerabilities.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h3 class="SECT2"><a name="OTHERADS" id="OTHERADS">1.16. Can I use Privoxy with other ad-blocking
      software?</a></h3>
      <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> should work fine with other proxies and other software in
      general.</p>
      <p>But it is probably not necessary to use <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> in conjunction with other
      ad-blocking products, and this could conceivably cause undesirable results. It might be better to choose one
      software or the other and work a little to tweak its configuration to your liking.</p>

      explicitly agreed to the changes).</p>
