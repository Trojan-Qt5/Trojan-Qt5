  <h2>NAME</h2>
  <pre>
<!-- Manpage converted by man2html 3.0.1 -->

</pre>
  <h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
  <pre>
       <b>privoxy</b> [<b>--chroot</b> ] [<b>--config-test</b> ] [<b>--help</b> ] [<b>--no-daemon</b> ]
       [<b>--pidfile</b> <i>pidfile</i> ] [<b>--pre-chroot-nslookup</b> <i>hostname</i> ] [<b>--user</b>
       <i>user[.group]</i> ] [<b>--version</b> ] [<i>configfile</i> ]



</pre>
  <h2>OPTIONS</h2>
  <pre>
       <b>Privoxy</b> may be invoked with the following command line options:

       <b>--chroot</b>
              Before changing to the user ID given in the --user option,
              chroot to that user's home directory, i.e. make the kernel
              pretend to the <b>Privoxy</b> process that the directory tree starts
              there. If set up carefully, this can limit the impact of
              possible vulnerabilities in <b>Privoxy</b> to the files contained in
              that hierarchy.

       <b>--config-test</b>
              Exit after loading the configuration files before binding to the
              listen address. The exit code signals whether or not the
              configuration files have been successfully loaded.

              If the exit code is 1, at least one of the configuration files
              is invalid, if it is 0, all the configuration files have been
              successfully loaded (but may still contain errors that can
              currently only be detected at run time).

              This option doesn't affect the log setting, combination with
              "--no-daemon" is recommended if a configured log file shouldn't
              be used.

       <b>--help</b> Print brief usage info and exit.

       <b>--no-daemon</b>
              Don't  become  a daemon, i.e. don't fork and become process
              group leader, don't detach from controlling tty, and do all
              logging there.

       <b>--pidfile</b> <i>pidfile</i>
              On startup, write the process ID to <i>pidfile</i>.  Delete the <i>pidfile</i>
              on exit.  Failure to create or delete the <i>pidfile</i> is non-fatal.
              If no <b>--pidfile</b> option is given, no PID file will be used.

       <b>--pre-chroot-nslookup</b> <i>hostname</i>
              Initialize the resolver library using <i>hostname</i> before
              chroot'ing. On some systems this reduces the number of files
              that must be copied into the chroot tree.

       <b>--user</b> <i>user[.group]</i>
              After (optionally) writing the PID file, assume the user ID of
              <i>user</i> and the GID of <i>group</i>, or, if the optional <i>group</i> was not
              given, the default group of <i>user</i>. Exit if the privileges are not

       individual needs and tastes.  It has application for both stand-alone
       systems and multi-user networks.

  <h2>INSTALLATION AND USAGE</h2>
  <pre>
       Browsers can either be individually configured to use <b>Privoxy</b> as a HTTP
       proxy (recommended), or <b>Privoxy</b> can be combined with a packet filter to
       build an intercepting proxy (see <i>config</i>).  The default setting is  for
       localhost,  on port  8118 (configurable in the main config file).  To
       set the HTTP proxy in Firefox, go through: <b>Tools</b>; <b>Options</b>; <b>General</b>;
       <b>Connection</b> <b>Settings</b>; <b>Manual</b> <b>Proxy</b> <b>Configuration</b>.

       For Internet Explorer, go through: <b>Tools</b>; <b>Internet</b> <b>Properties</b>;
       <b>Connections</b>; <b>LAN</b> <b>Settings</b>.

       The Secure (SSL) Proxy should also be set to the same values, otherwise
       https: URLs will not be proxied. Note: <b>Privoxy</b> can only proxy HTTP and
       HTTPS traffic. Do not try it with FTP or other protocols.  HTTPS
       presents some limitations, and not all features will work with HTTPS
       connections.

       For other browsers, check the documentation.


</pre>
  <h2>CONFIGURATION</h2>
  <pre>
       <b>Privoxy</b> can be configured with the various configuration files. The
       default configuration files are: <i>config</i>, <i>default.filter</i>, <i>default.action</i>
       and <i>default.action</i>. <i>user.action</i> should be used for locally defined
       exceptions to the default rules in <i>match-all.action</i> and <i>default.action</i>,
       and <i>user.filter</i> for locally defined filters. These are well commented.
       On Unix and Unix-like systems, these are located in <i>/etc/privoxy/</i> by
       default.

       <b>Privoxy</b> uses the concept of <b>actions</b> in order to manipulate the data
       stream between the browser and remote sites.  There are various actions
       available with specific functions for such things as blocking web
       sites, managing cookies, etc. These actions can be invoked individually
       or combined, and used against individual URLs, or groups of URLs that
       can be defined using wildcards and regular expressions. The result is
       that the user has greatly enhanced control and freedom.

       The actions list (ad blocks, etc) can also be configured with your web
       browser at http://config.privoxy.org/ (assuming the configuration
        <i>/etc/privoxy/user.filter</i>
        <i>/etc/privoxy/trust</i>
        <i>/etc/privoxy/templates/*</i>
        <i>/var/log/privoxy/logfile</i>

       Various other files should be included, but may vary depending on
       platform and build configuration. Additional documentation should be
       included in the local documentation directory.

  <h2>SIGNALS</h2>
  <pre>
       <b>Privoxy</b> terminates on the <b>SIGINT</b> and <b>SIGTERM</b> signals. Log rotation
       scripts may cause a re-opening of the logfile by sending a <b>SIGHUP</b> to
       <b>Privoxy</b>. Note that unlike other daemons,  <b>Privoxy</b> does not need to be
       made aware of config file changes by <b>SIGHUP</b> -- it will detect them
       automatically. Signals other than the ones listed above aren't
       explicitly handled and result in the default action defined by the
       operating system.
