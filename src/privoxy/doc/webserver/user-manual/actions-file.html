    <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="ACTIONS-FILE" id="ACTIONS-FILE">8. Actions Files</a></h1>
    <p>The actions files are used to define what <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">actions</i></span>
    <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> takes for which URLs, and thus determines how ad images, cookies and
    various other aspects of HTTP content and transactions are handled, and on which sites (or even parts thereof).
    There are a number of such actions, with a wide range of functionality. Each action does something a little
    different. These actions give us a veritable arsenal of tools with which to exert our control, preferences and
    independence. Actions can be combined so that their effects are aggregated when applied against a given set of
    URLs.</p>
    <p>There are three action files included with <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> with differing purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><tt class="FILENAME">match-all.action</tt> - is used to define which <span class="QUOTE">"actions"</span>
        relating to banner-blocking, images, pop-ups, content modification, cookie handling etc should be applied by
        default. It should be the first actions file loaded</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt> - defines many exceptions (both positive and negative) from the
        default set of actions that's configured in <tt class="FILENAME">match-all.action</tt>. It is a set of rules
        that should work reasonably well as-is for most users. This file is only supposed to be edited by the
        developers. It should be the second actions file loaded.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><tt class="FILENAME">user.action</tt> - is intended to be for local site preferences and exceptions. As an
        example, if your ISP or your bank has specific requirements, and need special handling, this kind of thing
        should go here. This file will not be upgraded.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><span class="GUIBUTTON">Edit</span> <span class="GUIBUTTON">Set to Cautious</span> <span class=
        "GUIBUTTON">Set to Medium</span> <span class="GUIBUTTON">Set to Advanced</span></p>
        <p>These have increasing levels of aggressiveness <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">and have no
        influence on your browsing unless you select them explicitly in the editor</i></span>. A default installation
        should be pre-set to <tt class="LITERAL">Cautious</tt>. New users should try this for a while before adjusting
        the settings to more aggressive levels. The more aggressive the settings, then the more likelihood there is of
        problems such as sites not working as they should.</p>
        <p>The <span class="GUIBUTTON">Edit</span> button allows you to turn each action on/off individually for
        fine-tuning. The <span class="GUIBUTTON">Cautious</span> button changes the actions list to low/safe settings
        which will activate ad blocking and a minimal set of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>'s features, and
        subsequently there will be less of a chance for accidental problems. The <span class="GUIBUTTON">Medium</span>
        button sets the list to a medium level of other features and a low level set of privacy features. The
        <span class="GUIBUTTON">Advanced</span> button sets the list to a high level of ad blocking and medium level of
        privacy. See the chart below. The latter three buttons over-ride any changes via with the <span class=
        "GUIBUTTON">Edit</span> button. More fine-tuning can be done in the lower sections of this internal page.</p>
        <p>While the actions file editor allows to enable these settings in all actions files, they are only supposed
        to be enabled in the first one to make sure you don't unintentionally overrule earlier rules.</p>
        <p>The default profiles, and their associated actions, as pre-defined in <tt class=
        "FILENAME">default.action</tt> are:</p>

    <p>The list of actions files to be used are defined in the main configuration file, and are processed in the order
    they are defined (e.g. <tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt> is typically processed before <tt class=
    "FILENAME">user.action</tt>). The content of these can all be viewed and edited from <a href=
    "http://config.privoxy.org/show-status" target="_top">http://config.privoxy.org/show-status</a>. The over-riding
    principle when applying actions, is that the last action that matches a given URL wins. The broadest, most general
    rules go first (defined in <tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt>), followed by any exceptions (typically also in
    <tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt>), which are then followed lastly by any local preferences (typically in
    <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">user</i></span><tt class="FILENAME">.action</tt>). Generally, <tt class=
    "FILENAME">user.action</tt> has the last word.</p>
    <p>An actions file typically has multiple sections. If you want to use <span class="QUOTE">"aliases"</span> in an
    actions file, you have to place the (optional) <a href="actions-file.html#ALIASES">alias section</a> at the top of
    that file. Then comes the default set of rules which will apply universally to all sites and pages (be <span class=
    "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">very careful</i></span> with using such a universal set in <tt class=
    "FILENAME">user.action</tt> or any other actions file after <tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt>, because it
    will override the result from consulting any previous file). And then below that, exceptions to the defined
    universal policies. You can regard <tt class="FILENAME">user.action</tt> as an appendix to <tt class=
    "FILENAME">default.action</tt>, with the advantage that it is a separate file, which makes preserving your personal
    settings across <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> upgrades easier.</p>
    <p>Actions can be used to block anything you want, including ads, banners, or just some obnoxious URL whose content
    you would rather not see. Cookies can be accepted or rejected, or accepted only during the current browser session
    (i.e. not written to disk), content can be modified, some JavaScripts tamed, user-tracking fooled, and much more.
    See below for a <a href="actions-file.html#ACTIONS">complete list of actions</a>.</p>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="RIGHT-MIX" id="RIGHT-MIX">8.1. Finding the Right Mix</a></h2>
      <p>Note that some <a href="actions-file.html#ACTIONS">actions</a>, like cookie suppression or script disabling,
      may render some sites unusable that rely on these techniques to work properly. Finding the right mix of actions
      is not always easy and certainly a matter of personal taste. And, things can always change, requiring refinements
      in the configuration. In general, it can be said that the more <span class="QUOTE">"aggressive"</span> your
      default settings (in the top section of the actions file) are, the more exceptions for <span class=
      "QUOTE">"trusted"</span> sites you will have to make later. If, for example, you want to crunch all cookies per
      default, you'll have to make exceptions from that rule for sites that you regularly use and that require cookies
      for actually useful purposes, like maybe your bank, favorite shop, or newspaper.</p>
      <p>We have tried to provide you with reasonable rules to start from in the distribution actions files. But there
      is no general rule of thumb on these things. There just are too many variables, and sites are constantly
      changing. Sooner or later you will want to change the rules (and read this chapter again :).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="HOW-TO-EDIT" id="HOW-TO-EDIT">8.2. How to Edit</a></h2>
      <p>The easiest way to edit the actions files is with a browser by using our browser-based editor, which can be
      reached from <a href="http://config.privoxy.org/show-status" target=
      "_top">http://config.privoxy.org/show-status</a>. Note: the config file option <a href=
      "config.html#ENABLE-EDIT-ACTIONS">enable-edit-actions</a> must be enabled for this to work. The editor allows
      both fine-grained control over every single feature on a per-URL basis, and easy choosing from wholesale sets of
      defaults like <span class="QUOTE">"Cautious"</span>, <span class="QUOTE">"Medium"</span> or <span class=
      "QUOTE">"Advanced"</span>. Warning: the <span class="QUOTE">"Advanced"</span> setting is more aggressive, and
      will be more likely to cause problems for some sites. Experienced users only!</p>
      <p>If you prefer plain text editing to GUIs, you can of course also directly edit the the actions files with your
      favorite text editor. Look at <tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt> which is richly commented with many good
      examples.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="ACTIONS-APPLY" id="ACTIONS-APPLY">8.3. How Actions are Applied to Requests</a></h2>
      <p>Actions files are divided into sections. There are special sections, like the <span class="QUOTE">"<a href=
      "actions-file.html#ALIASES">alias</a>"</span> sections which will be discussed later. For now let's concentrate
      on regular sections: They have a heading line (often split up to multiple lines for readability) which consist of
      a list of actions, separated by whitespace and enclosed in curly braces. Below that, there is a list of URL and
      tag patterns, each on a separate line.</p>
      <p>To determine which actions apply to a request, the URL of the request is compared to all URL patterns in each
      <span class="QUOTE">"action file"</span>. Every time it matches, the list of applicable actions for the request
      is incrementally updated, using the heading of the section in which the pattern is located. The same is done
      again for tags and tag patterns later on.</p>
      <p>If multiple applying sections set the same action differently, the last match wins. If not, the effects are
      aggregated. E.g. a URL might match a regular section with a heading line of <tt class="LITERAL">{ +<a href=
      "actions-file.html#HANDLE-AS-IMAGE">handle-as-image</a> }</tt>, then later another one with just <tt class=
      "LITERAL">{ +<a href="actions-file.html#BLOCK">block</a> }</tt>, resulting in <span class="emphasis"><i class=
      "EMPHASIS">both</i></span> actions to apply. And there may well be cases where you will want to combine actions
      together. Such a section then might look like:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN">  { +<tt class="LITERAL">handle-as-image</tt>  +<tt class=
            "LITERAL">block{Banner ads.}</tt> }
  # Block these as if they were images. Send no block page.
   banners.example.com
   media.example.com/.*banners
   .example.com/images/ads/</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>You can trace this process for URL patterns and any given URL by visiting <a href=
      "http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info" target="_top">http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info</a>.</p>
      <p>Examples and more detail on this is provided in the Appendix, <a href=
      "appendix.html#ACTIONSANAT">Troubleshooting: Anatomy of an Action</a> section.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AF-PATTERNS" id="AF-PATTERNS">8.4. Patterns</a></h2>
      <p>As mentioned, <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> uses <span class="QUOTE">"patterns"</span> to determine
      what <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">actions</i></span> might apply to which sites and pages your
      browser attempts to access. These <span class="QUOTE">"patterns"</span> use wild card type <span class=
      "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">pattern</i></span> matching to achieve a high degree of flexibility. This allows
      one expression to be expanded and potentially match against many similar patterns.</p>
      <p>Generally, an URL pattern has the form <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;host&gt;&lt;port&gt;/&lt;path&gt;</tt>, where
      the <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;host&gt;</tt>, the <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;port&gt;</tt> and the <tt class=
      "LITERAL">&lt;path&gt;</tt> are optional. (This is why the special <tt class="LITERAL">/</tt> pattern matches all
      URLs). Note that the protocol portion of the URL pattern (e.g. <tt class="LITERAL">http://</tt>) should
      <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">not</i></span> be included in the pattern. This is assumed
      already!</p>
      <p>The pattern matching syntax is different for the host and path parts of the URL. The host part uses a simple
      globbing type matching technique, while the path part uses more flexible <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions" target="_top"><span class="QUOTE">"Regular
      Expressions"</span></a> (POSIX 1003.2).</p>
      <p>The port part of a pattern is a decimal port number preceded by a colon (<tt class="LITERAL">:</tt>). If the
      host part contains a numerical IPv6 address, it has to be put into angle brackets (<tt class="LITERAL">&lt;</tt>,
      <tt class="LITERAL">&gt;</tt>).</p>
      <div class="VARIABLELIST">
        <dl>
          <dt><tt class="LITERAL">www.example.com/</tt></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>is a host-only pattern and will match any request to <tt class="LITERAL">www.example.com</tt>,
            regardless of which document on that server is requested. So ALL pages in this domain would be covered by
            the scope of this action. Note that a simple <tt class="LITERAL">example.com</tt> is different and would
            NOT match.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><tt class="LITERAL">www.example.com</tt></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>means exactly the same. For host-only patterns, the trailing <tt class="LITERAL">/</tt> may be
            omitted.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt><tt class="LITERAL">www.example.com/index.html</tt></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>matches all the documents on <tt class="LITERAL">www.example.com</tt> whose name starts with <tt class=

          </dd>
          <dt><tt class="LITERAL">www.example.com/index.html$</tt></dt>
          <dd>
            <p>matches only the single document <tt class="LITERAL">/index.html</tt> on <tt class=

        <p>The matching of the host part offers some flexible options: if the host pattern starts or ends with a dot,

        used to match domain names and not IP addresses. For example:</p>
        <div class="VARIABLELIST">
          <dl>
            <dt><tt class="LITERAL">.example.com</tt></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>matches any domain with first-level domain <tt class="LITERAL">com</tt> and second-level domain
              <tt class="LITERAL">example</tt>. For example <tt class="LITERAL">www.example.com</tt>, <tt class=
              "LITERAL">example.com</tt> and <tt class="LITERAL">foo.bar.baz.example.com</tt>. Note that it wouldn't
              match if the second-level domain was <tt class="LITERAL">another-example</tt>.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><tt class="LITERAL">www.</tt></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>matches any domain that <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">STARTS</i></span> with <tt class=
              "LITERAL">www.</tt> (It also matches the domain <tt class="LITERAL">www</tt> but most of the time that
              doesn't matter.)</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><tt class="LITERAL">.example.</tt></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>matches any domain that <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">CONTAINS</i></span> <tt class=
              "LITERAL">.example.</tt>. And, by the way, also included would be any files or documents that exist
              within that domain since no path limitations are specified. (Correctly speaking: It matches any FQDN that
              contains <tt class="LITERAL">example</tt> as a domain.) This might be <tt class=
              "LITERAL">www.example.com</tt>, <tt class="LITERAL">news.example.de</tt>, or <tt class=
              "LITERAL">www.example.net/cgi/testing.pl</tt> for instance. All these cases are matched.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </div>
        <p>Additionally, there are wild-cards that you can use in the domain names themselves. These work similarly to
        shell globbing type wild-cards: <span class="QUOTE">"*"</span> represents zero or more arbitrary characters
        (this is equivalent to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions" target=
        "_top"><span class="QUOTE">"Regular Expression"</span></a> based syntax of <span class="QUOTE">".*"</span>),
        <span class="QUOTE">"?"</span> represents any single character (this is equivalent to the regular expression
        syntax of a simple <span class="QUOTE">"."</span>), and you can define <span class="QUOTE">"character
        classes"</span> in square brackets which is similar to the same regular expression technique. All of this can
        be freely mixed:</p>
        <div class="VARIABLELIST">
          <dl>
            <dt><tt class="LITERAL">ad*.example.com</tt></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>matches <span class="QUOTE">"adserver.example.com"</span>, <span class=
              "QUOTE">"ads.example.com"</span>, etc but not <span class="QUOTE">"sfads.example.com"</span></p>
            </dd>
            <dt><tt class="LITERAL">*ad*.example.com</tt></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>matches all of the above, and then some.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><tt class="LITERAL">.?pix.com</tt></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>matches <tt class="LITERAL">www.ipix.com</tt>, <tt class="LITERAL">pictures.epix.com</tt>, <tt class=
              "LITERAL">a.b.c.d.e.upix.com</tt> etc.</p>
            </dd>
            <dt><tt class="LITERAL">www[1-9a-ez].example.c*</tt></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>matches <tt class="LITERAL">www1.example.com</tt>, <tt class="LITERAL">www4.example.cc</tt>,
              <tt class="LITERAL">wwwd.example.cy</tt>, <tt class="LITERAL">wwwz.example.com</tt> etc., but

            </dd>
          </dl>
        </div>
        <p>While flexible, this is not the sophistication of full regular expression based syntax.</p>

        <p>Note that the path pattern is automatically left-anchored at the <span class="QUOTE">"/"</span>, i.e. it

        of a line).</p>
        <p>Please also note that matching in the path is <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">CASE

        <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="TAG-PATTERN" id="TAG-PATTERN">8.4.3. The Request Tag Pattern</a></h3>
        <p>Request tag patterns are used to change the applying actions based on the request's tags. Tags can be
        created based on HTTP headers with either the <a href=
        "actions-file.html#CLIENT-HEADER-TAGGER">client-header-tagger</a> or the <a href=
        "actions-file.html#SERVER-HEADER-TAGGER">server-header-tagger</a> action.</p>
        <p>Request tag patterns have to start with <span class="QUOTE">"TAG:"</span>, so <span class=
        "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> can tell them apart from other patterns. Everything after the colon including
        white space, is interpreted as a regular expression with path pattern syntax, except that tag patterns aren't
        left-anchored automatically (<span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> doesn't silently add a <span class=
        "QUOTE">"^"</span>, you have to do it yourself if you need it).</p>
        <p>To match all requests that are tagged with <span class="QUOTE">"foo"</span> your pattern line should be
        <span class="QUOTE">"TAG:^foo$"</span>, <span class="QUOTE">"TAG:foo"</span> would work as well, but it would
        also match requests whose tags contain <span class="QUOTE">"foo"</span> somewhere. <span class="QUOTE">"TAG:
        foo"</span> wouldn't work as it requires white space.</p>
        <p>Sections can contain URL and request tag patterns at the same time, but request tag patterns are checked
        after the URL patterns and thus always overrule them, even if they are located before the URL patterns.</p>
        <p>Once a new request tag is added, Privoxy checks right away if it's matched by one of the request tag
        patterns and updates the action settings accordingly. As a result request tags can be used to activate other
        tagger actions, as long as these other taggers look for headers that haven't already be parsed.</p>
        <p>For example you could tag client requests which use the <tt class="LITERAL">POST</tt> method, then use this
        tag to activate another tagger that adds a tag if cookies are sent, and then use a block action based on the
        cookie tag. This allows the outcome of one action, to be input into a subsequent action. However if you'd
        reverse the position of the described taggers, and activated the method tagger based on the cookie tagger, no
        method tags would be created. The method tagger would look for the request line, but at the time the cookie tag
        is created, the request line has already been parsed.</p>
        <p>While this is a limitation you should be aware of, this kind of indirection is seldom needed anyway and even
        the example doesn't make too much sense.</p>

        <p>Negative request tag patterns created with <span class="QUOTE">"NO-REQUEST-TAG:"</span> are checked after
        all client headers are scanned, the ones created with <span class="QUOTE">"NO-RESPONSE-TAG:"</span> are checked

        <p>Client tag patterns are not set based on HTTP headers but based on the client's IP address. Users can enable
        them themselves, but the Privoxy admin controls which tags are available and what their effect is.</p>
        <p>After a client-specific tag has been defined with the <a href=
        "config.html#CLIENT-SPECIFIC-TAG">client-specific-tag</a>, directive, action sections can be activated based on
        the tag by using a CLIENT-TAG pattern. The CLIENT-TAG pattern is evaluated at the same priority as URL
        patterns, as a result the last matching pattern wins. Tags that are created based on client or server headers
        are evaluated later on and can overrule CLIENT-TAG and URL patterns!</p>
        <p>The tag is set for all requests that come from clients that requested it to be set. Note that "clients" are
        differentiated by IP address, if the IP address changes the tag has to be requested again.</p>
        <p>Clients can request tags to be set by using the CGI interface <a href=
        "http://config.privoxy.org/client-tags" target="_top">http://config.privoxy.org/client-tags</a>.</p>

      <p>All actions are disabled by default, until they are explicitly enabled somewhere in an actions file. Actions
      are turned on if preceded with a <span class="QUOTE">"+"</span>, and turned off if preceded with a <span class=

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>Note that if the URL matches multiple positive forms of a parameterized action, the last match wins, i.e.
          the params from earlier matches are simply ignored.</p>

          <p>Multi-value. These look exactly like parameterized actions, but they behave differently: If the action

          "EMPHASIS">all</i></span> the parameters from <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">all</i></span>
          matches are remembered. This is used for actions that can be executed for the same request repeatedly, like
          adding multiple headers, or filtering through multiple filters. Syntax:</p>

      <p>If nothing is specified in any actions file, no <span class="QUOTE">"actions"</span> are taken. So in this

      specifically enable the privacy and blocking features you need (although the provided default actions files will
      give a good starting point).</p>
      <p>Later defined action sections always over-ride earlier ones of the same type. So exceptions to any rules you
      make, should come in the latter part of the file (or in a file that is processed later when using multiple
      actions files such as <tt class="FILENAME">user.action</tt>). For multi-valued actions, the actions are applied
      in the order they are specified. Actions files are processed in the order they are defined in <tt class=
      "FILENAME">config</tt> (the default installation has three actions files). It also quite possible for any given
      URL to match more than one <span class="QUOTE">"pattern"</span> (because of wildcards and regular expressions),
      and thus to trigger more than one set of actions! Last match wins.</p>

              <p>Client-header filters are applied to each header on its own, not to all at once. This makes it easier
              to diagnose problems, but on the downside you can't write filters that only change header x if header y's
              value is z. You can do that by using tags though.</p>
              <p>Client-header filters are executed after the other header actions have finished and use their output
              as input.</p>
              <p>If the request URI gets changed, <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> will detect that and use the

              <p>The <span class="QUOTE">"Content-Type:"</span> HTTP server header is used by the browser to decide
              what to do with the document. The value of this header can cause the browser to open a download menu
              instead of displaying the document by itself, even if the document's format is supported by the
              browser.</p>
              <p>The declared content type can also affect which rendering mode the browser chooses. If XHTML is
              delivered as <span class="QUOTE">"text/html"</span>, many browsers treat it as yet another broken HTML
              document. If it is send as <span class="QUOTE">"application/xml"</span>, browsers with XHTML support will
              only display it, if the syntax is correct.</p>
              <p>If you see a web site that proudly uses XHTML buttons, but sets <span class="QUOTE">"Content-Type:
              text/html"</span>, you can use <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> to overwrite it with <span class=
              "QUOTE">"application/xml"</span> and validate the web master's claim inside your XHTML-supporting
              browser. If the syntax is incorrect, the browser will complain loudly.</p>
              <p>You can also go the opposite direction: if your browser prints error messages instead of rendering a
              document falsely declared as XHTML, you can overwrite the content type with <span class=
              "QUOTE">"text/html"</span> and have it rendered as broken HTML document.</p>
              <p>By default <tt class="LITERAL">content-type-overwrite</tt> only replaces <span class=
              "QUOTE">"Content-Type:"</span> headers that look like some kind of text. If you want to overwrite it
              unconditionally, you have to combine it with <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
              "actions-file.html#FORCE-TEXT-MODE">force-text-mode</a></tt>. This limitation exists for a reason, think
              twice before circumventing it.</p>
              <p>Most of the time it's easier to replace this action with a custom <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
              "actions-file.html#SERVER-HEADER-FILTER">server-header filter</a></tt>. It allows you to activate it for
              every document of a certain site and it will still only replace the content types you aimed at.</p>
              <p>Of course you can apply <tt class="LITERAL">content-type-overwrite</tt> to a whole site and then make
              URL based exceptions, but it's a lot more work to get the same precision.</p>

              <p>Many sites, like yahoo.com, don't just link to other sites. Instead, they will link to some script on
              their own servers, giving the destination as a parameter, which will then redirect you to the final
              target. URLs resulting from this scheme typically look like: <span class=
              "QUOTE">"http://www.example.org/click-tracker.cgi?target=http%3a//www.example.net/"</span>.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, there are even multiple consecutive redirects encoded in the URL. These redirections via
              scripts make your web browsing more traceable, since the server from which you follow such a link can see
              where you go to. Apart from that, valuable bandwidth and time is wasted, while your browser asks the
              server for one redirect after the other. Plus, it feeds the advertisers.</p>
              <p>This feature is currently not very smart and is scheduled for improvement. If it is enabled by
              default, you will have to create some exceptions to this action. It can lead to failures in several
              ways:</p>
              <p>Not every URLs with other URLs as parameters is evil. Some sites offer a real service that requires
              this information to work. For example a validation service needs to know, which document to validate.
              <tt class="LITERAL">fast-redirects</tt> assumes that every URL parameter that looks like another URL is a
              redirection target, and will always redirect to the last one. Most of the time the assumption is correct,
              but if it isn't, the user gets redirected anyway.</p>
              <p>Another failure occurs if the URL contains other parameters after the URL parameter. The URL:
              <span class="QUOTE">"http://www.example.org/?redirect=http%3a//www.example.net/&amp;foo=bar"</span>.
              contains the redirection URL <span class="QUOTE">"http://www.example.net/"</span>, followed by another
              parameter. <tt class="LITERAL">fast-redirects</tt> doesn't know that and will cause a redirect to
              <span class="QUOTE">"http://www.example.net/&amp;foo=bar"</span>. Depending on the target server
              configuration, the parameter will be silently ignored or lead to a <span class="QUOTE">"page not
              found"</span> error. You can prevent this problem by first using the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
              "actions-file.html#REDIRECT">redirect</a></tt> action to remove the last part of the URL, but it requires
              a little effort.</p>
              <p>To detect a redirection URL, <tt class="LITERAL">fast-redirects</tt> only looks for the string
              <span class="QUOTE">"http://"</span>, either in plain text (invalid but often used) or encoded as
              <span class="QUOTE">"http%3a//"</span>. Some sites use their own URL encoding scheme, encrypt the address
              of the target server or replace it with a database id. In theses cases <tt class=
              "LITERAL">fast-redirects</tt> is fooled and the request reaches the redirection server where it probably
              gets logged.</p>

              <p>For your convenience, there are a number of pre-defined filters available in the distribution filter
              file that you can use. See the examples below for a list.</p>
              <p>Filtering requires buffering the page content, which may appear to slow down page rendering since
              nothing is displayed until all content has passed the filters. (The total time until the page is
              completely rendered doesn't change much, but it may be perceived as slower since the page is not
              incrementally displayed.) This effect will be more noticeable on slower connections.</p>
              <p><span class="QUOTE">"Rolling your own"</span> filters requires a knowledge of <a href=
              "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions" target="_top"><span class="QUOTE">"Regular
              Expressions"</span></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Html" target="_top"><span class=
              "QUOTE">"HTML"</span></a>. This is very powerful feature, and potentially very intrusive. Filters should
              be used with caution, and where an equivalent <span class="QUOTE">"action"</span> is not available.</p>
              <p>The amount of data that can be filtered is limited to the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
              "config.html#BUFFER-LIMIT">buffer-limit</a></tt> option in the main <a href="config.html">config
              file</a>. The default is 4096 KB (4 Megs). Once this limit is exceeded, the buffered data, and all
              pending data, is passed through unfiltered.</p>
              <p>Inappropriate MIME types, such as zipped files, are not filtered at all. (Again, only text-based types
              except plain text). Encrypted SSL data (from HTTPS servers) cannot be filtered either, since this would
              violate the integrity of the secure transaction. In some situations it might be necessary to protect
              certain text, like source code, from filtering by defining appropriate <tt class="LITERAL">-filter</tt>
              exceptions.</p>
              <p>Compressed content can't be filtered either, but if <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is
              compiled with zlib support and a supported compression algorithm is used (gzip or deflate), <span class=
              "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> can first decompress the content and then filter it.</p>
              <p>If you use a <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> version without zlib support, but want filtering
              to work on as much documents as possible, even those that would normally be sent compressed, you must use
              the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href="actions-file.html#PREVENT-COMPRESSION">prevent-compression</a></tt>
              action in conjunction with <tt class="LITERAL">filter</tt>.</p>
              <p>Content filtering can achieve some of the same effects as the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
              "actions-file.html#BLOCK">block</a></tt> action, i.e. it can be used to block ads and banners. But the
              mechanism works quite differently. One effective use, is to block ad banners based on their size (see
              below), since many of these seem to be somewhat standardized.</p>

                  <p>Using Privoxy for webservers that are only reachable through onion addresses and whose location is

              <p>Before setting the <span class="QUOTE">"Accept-Language:"</span> header to a rare language, you should
              consider that it helps to make your requests unique and thus easier to trace. If you don't plan to change

              <p>Always blocking the referrer, or using a custom one, can lead to failures on servers that check the

              <p>More and more websites send their content compressed by default, which is generally a good idea and
              saves bandwidth. But the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href="actions-file.html#FILTER">filter</a></tt> and
              <tt class="LITERAL"><a href="actions-file.html#DEANIMATE-GIFS">deanimate-gifs</a></tt> actions need
              access to the uncompressed data.</p>
              <p>When compiled with zlib support (available since <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> 3.0.7),
              content that should be filtered is decompressed on-the-fly and you don't have to worry about this action.
              If you are using an older <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> version, or one that hasn't been
              compiled with zlib support, this action can be used to convince the server to send the content
              uncompressed.</p>
              <p>Most text-based instances compress very well, the size is seldom decreased by less than 50%, for
              markup-heavy instances like news feeds saving more than 90% of the original size isn't unusual.</p>
              <p>Not using compression will therefore slow down the transfer, and you should only enable this action if
              you really need it. As of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> 3.0.7 it's disabled in all predefined
              action settings.</p>
              <p>Note that some (rare) ill-configured sites don't handle requests for uncompressed documents correctly.
              Broken PHP applications tend to send an empty document body, some IIS versions only send the beginning of
              the content. If you enable <tt class="LITERAL">prevent-compression</tt> per default, you might want to
              add exceptions for those sites. See the example for how to do that.</p>

            <dd>
              <p>Removing the <span class="QUOTE">"Last-Modified:"</span> header is useful for filter testing, where
              you want to force a real reload instead of getting status code <span class="QUOTE">"304"</span>, which
              would cause the browser to reuse the old version of the page.</p>
              <p>The <span class="QUOTE">"randomize"</span> option overwrites the value of the <span class=
              "QUOTE">"Last-Modified:"</span> header with a randomly chosen time between the original value and the
              current time. In theory the server could send each document with a different <span class=
              "QUOTE">"Last-Modified:"</span> header to track visits without using cookies. <span class=
              "QUOTE">"Randomize"</span> makes it impossible and the browser can still revalidate cached documents.</p>
              <p><span class="QUOTE">"reset-to-request-time"</span> overwrites the value of the <span class=
              "QUOTE">"Last-Modified:"</span> header with the current time. You could use this option together with
              <tt class="LITERAL"><a href="actions-file.html#HIDE-IF-MODIFIED-SINCE">hide-if-modified-since</a></tt> to
              further customize your random range.</p>
              <p>The preferred parameter here is <span class="QUOTE">"randomize"</span>. It is safe to use, as long as
              the time settings are more or less correct. If the server sets the <span class=
              "QUOTE">"Last-Modified:"</span> header to the time of the request, the random range becomes zero and the
              value stays the same. Therefore you should later randomize it a second time with <tt class=
              "LITERAL"><a href="actions-file.html#HIDE-IF-MODIFIED-SINCE">hided-if-modified-since</a></tt>, just to be

        <p>Note that many of these actions have the potential to cause a page to misbehave, possibly even not to
        display at all. There are many ways a site designer may choose to design his site, and what HTTP header
        content, and other criteria, he may depend on. There is no way to have hard and fast rules for all sites. See
        the <a href="appendix.html#ACTIONSANAT">Appendix</a> for a brief example on troubleshooting actions.</p>

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="ALIASES" id="ALIASES">8.6. Aliases</a></h2>
      <p>Custom <span class="QUOTE">"actions"</span>, known to <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> as <span class=
      "QUOTE">"aliases"</span>, can be defined by combining other actions. These can in turn be invoked just like the
      built-in actions. Currently, an alias name can contain any character except space, tab, <span class=
      "QUOTE">"="</span>, <span class="QUOTE">"{"</span> and <span class="QUOTE">"}"</span>, but we <span class=
      "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">strongly recommend</i></span> that you only use <span class="QUOTE">"a"</span> to
      <span class="QUOTE">"z"</span>, <span class="QUOTE">"0"</span> to <span class="QUOTE">"9"</span>, <span class=
      "QUOTE">"+"</span>, and <span class="QUOTE">"-"</span>. Alias names are not case sensitive, and are not required
      to start with a <span class="QUOTE">"+"</span> or <span class="QUOTE">"-"</span> sign, since they are merely
      textually expanded.</p>
      <p>Aliases can be used throughout the actions file, but they <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">must be
      defined in a special section at the top of the file!</i></span> And there can only be one such section per
      actions file. Each actions file may have its own alias section, and the aliases defined in it are only visible
      within that file.</p>
      <p>There are two main reasons to use aliases: One is to save typing for frequently used combinations of actions,
      the other one is a gain in flexibility: If you decide once how you want to handle shops by defining an alias
      called <span class="QUOTE">"shop"</span>, you can later change your policy on shops in <span class=
      "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">one</i></span> place, and your changes will take effect everywhere in the actions
      file where the <span class="QUOTE">"shop"</span> alias is used. Calling aliases by their purpose also makes your
      actions files more readable.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is one big drawback to using aliases, though: <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>'s
      built-in web-based action file editor honors aliases when reading the actions files, but it expands them before
      writing. So the effects of your aliases are of course preserved, but the aliases themselves are lost when you
      edit sections that use aliases with it.</p>
      <p>Now let's define some aliases...</p>

          </td>

      </table>
      <p>...and put them to use. These sections would appear in the lower part of an actions file and define exceptions
      to the default actions (as specified further up for the <span class="QUOTE">"/"</span> pattern):</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">

      <p>Aliases like <span class="QUOTE">"shop"</span> and <span class="QUOTE">"fragile"</span> are typically used for
      <span class="QUOTE">"problem"</span> sites that require more than one action to be disabled in order to function

    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="ACT-EXAMPLES" id="ACT-EXAMPLES">8.7. Actions Files Tutorial</a></h2>
      <p>The above chapters have shown <a href="actions-file.html">which actions files there are and how they are
      organized</a>, how actions are <a href="actions-file.html#ACTIONS">specified</a> and <a href=
      "actions-file.html#ACTIONS-APPLY">applied to URLs</a>, how <a href="actions-file.html#AF-PATTERNS">patterns</a>
      work, and how to define and use <a href="actions-file.html#ALIASES">aliases</a>. Now, let's look at an example
      <tt class="FILENAME">match-all.action</tt>, <tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt> and <tt class=
      "FILENAME">user.action</tt> file and see how all these pieces come together:</p>
      <div class="SECT3">
        <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="MATCH-ALL" id="MATCH-ALL">8.7.1. match-all.action</a></h3>
        <p>Remember <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">all actions are disabled when matching
        starts</i></span>, so we have to explicitly enable the ones we want.</p>
        <p>While the <tt class="FILENAME">match-all.action</tt> file only contains a single section, it is probably the
        most important one. It has only one pattern, <span class="QUOTE">"<tt class="LITERAL">/</tt>"</span>, but this
        pattern <a href="actions-file.html#AF-PATTERNS">matches all URLs</a>. Therefore, the set of actions used in
        this <span class="QUOTE">"default"</span> section <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">will be applied to
        all requests as a start</i></span>. It can be partly or wholly overridden by other actions files like
        <tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt> and <tt class="FILENAME">user.action</tt>, but it will still be
        largely responsible for your overall browsing experience.</p>
        <p>Again, at the start of matching, all actions are disabled, so there is no need to disable any actions here.
        (Remember: a <span class="QUOTE">"+"</span> preceding the action name enables the action, a <span class=
        "QUOTE">"-"</span> disables!). Also note how this long line has been made more readable by splitting it into
        multiple lines with line continuation.</p>

        <p>If you aren't a developer, there's no need for you to edit the <tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt>
        file. It is maintained by the <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> developers and if you disagree with some
        of the sections, you should overrule them in your <tt class="FILENAME">user.action</tt>.</p>
        <p>Understanding the <tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt> file can help you with your <tt class=

        <p>The first section in this file is a special section for internal use that prevents older <span class=

        </table>
        <p>The first of our specialized sections is concerned with <span class="QUOTE">"fragile"</span> sites, i.e.
        sites that require minimum interference, because they are either very complex or very keen on tracking you (and
        have mechanisms in place that make them unusable for people who avoid being tracked). We will use our
        pre-defined <tt class="LITERAL">fragile</tt> alias instead of stating the list of actions explicitly:</p>
        <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Shopping sites are not as fragile, but they typically require cookies to log in, and pop-up windows for
        shopping carts or item details. Again, we'll use a pre-defined alias:</p>
        <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The <tt class="LITERAL"><a href="actions-file.html#FAST-REDIRECTS">fast-redirects</a></tt> action, which may
        have been enabled in <tt class="FILENAME">match-all.action</tt>, breaks some sites. So disable it for popular
        sites where we know it misbehaves:</p>

        sent, rather than an HTML page. Contacting the remote site to find out is not an option, since it would destroy
        the loading time advantage of banner blocking, and it would feed the advertisers information about you. We can
        mark any URL as an image with the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
        "actions-file.html#HANDLE-AS-IMAGE">handle-as-image</a></tt> action, and marking all URLs that end in a known
        image file extension is a good start:</p>
        <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <pre class="SCREEN">##########################################################################
# Images:
##########################################################################

# Define which file types will be treated as images, in case they get
# blocked further down this file:
#

/.*\.(gif|jpe?g|png|bmp|ico)$</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>And then there are known banner sources. They often use scripts to generate the banners, so it won't be
        visible from the URL that the request is for an image. Hence we block them <span class="emphasis"><i class=
        "EMPHASIS">and</i></span> mark them as images in one go, with the help of our <tt class=
        "LITERAL">+block-as-image</tt> alias defined above. (We could of course just as well use <tt class=
        "LITERAL">+<a href="actions-file.html#BLOCK">block</a> +<a href=
        "actions-file.html#HANDLE-AS-IMAGE">handle-as-image</a></tt> here.) Remember that the type of the replacement
        image is chosen by the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
        "actions-file.html#SET-IMAGE-BLOCKER">set-image-blocker</a></tt> action. Since all URLs have matched the
        default section with its <tt class="LITERAL">+<a href=
        "actions-file.html#SET-IMAGE-BLOCKER">set-image-blocker</a>{pattern}</tt> action before, it still applies and
        needn't be repeated:</p>
        <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">

        <p>One of the most important jobs of <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is to block banners. Many of
        these can be <span class="QUOTE">"blocked"</span> by the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
        "actions-file.html#FILTER">filter</a>{banners-by-size}</tt> action, which we enabled above, and which deletes
        the references to banner images from the pages while they are loaded, so the browser doesn't request them
        anymore, and hence they don't need to be blocked here. But this naturally doesn't catch all banners, and some
        people choose not to use filters, so we need a comprehensive list of patterns for banner URLs here, and apply
        the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href="actions-file.html#BLOCK">block</a></tt> action to them.</p>
        <p>First comes many generic patterns, which do most of the work, by matching typical domain and path name
        components of banners. Then comes a list of individual patterns for specific sites, which is omitted here to
        keep the example short:</p>
        <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
          <tr>
            <td>
              <pre class="SCREEN">##########################################################################
# Block these fine banners:
##########################################################################
{ <a href="actions-file.html#BLOCK">+block{Banner ads.}</a> }

# Generic patterns:
#
ad*.
.*ads.
banner?.
count*.
/.*count(er)?\.(pl|cgi|exe|dll|asp|php[34]?)
/(?:.*/)?(publicite|werbung|rekla(ma|me|am)|annonse|maino(kset|nta|s)?)/

# Site-specific patterns (abbreviated):
#
.hitbox.com</pre>
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>It's quite remarkable how many advertisers actually call their banner servers ads.<tt class=
        "REPLACEABLE"><i>company</i></tt>.com, or call the directory in which the banners are stored literally
        <span class="QUOTE">"banners"</span>. So the above generic patterns are surprisingly effective.</p>
        <p>But being very generic, they necessarily also catch URLs that we don't want to block. The pattern <tt class=
        "LITERAL">.*ads.</tt> e.g. catches <span class="QUOTE">"nasty-<span class="emphasis"><i class=
        "EMPHASIS">ads</i></span>.nasty-corp.com"</span> as intended, but also <span class="QUOTE">"downlo<span class=
        "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">ads</i></span>.sourcefroge.net"</span> or <span class="QUOTE">"<span class=
        "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">ads</i></span>l.some-provider.net."</span> So here come some well-known
        exceptions to the <tt class="LITERAL">+<a href="actions-file.html#BLOCK">block</a></tt> section above.</p>
        <p>Note that these are exceptions to exceptions from the default! Consider the URL <span class=
        "QUOTE">"downloads.sourcefroge.net"</span>: Initially, all actions are deactivated, so it wouldn't get blocked.
        Then comes the defaults section, which matches the URL, but just deactivates the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
        "actions-file.html#BLOCK">block</a></tt> action once again. Then it matches <tt class="LITERAL">.*ads.</tt>, an
        exception to the general non-blocking policy, and suddenly <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
        "actions-file.html#BLOCK">+block</a></tt> applies. And now, it'll match <tt class="LITERAL">.*loads.</tt>,
        where <tt class="LITERAL"><a href="actions-file.html#BLOCK">-block</a></tt> applies, so (unless it matches
        <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">again</i></span> further down) it ends up with no <tt class=
        "LITERAL"><a href="actions-file.html#BLOCK">block</a></tt> action applying.</p>

        <p>So far we are painting with a broad brush by setting general policies, which would be a reasonable starting
        point for many people. Now, you might want to be more specific and have customized rules that are more suitable
        to your personal habits and preferences. These would be for narrowly defined situations like your ISP or your
        bank, and should be placed in <tt class="FILENAME">user.action</tt>, which is parsed after all other actions
        files and hence has the last word, over-riding any previously defined actions. <tt class=
        "FILENAME">user.action</tt> is also a <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">safe</i></span> place for your
        personal settings, since <tt class="FILENAME">default.action</tt> is actively maintained by the <span class=

        <span class="QUOTE">"copy image location"</span> and pasted the URL below while removing the leading http://,
        into a <tt class="LITERAL">{ +block{} }</tt> section. Note that <tt class="LITERAL">{ +handle-as-image }</tt>
        need not be specified, since all URLs ending in <tt class="LITERAL">.gif</tt> will be tagged as images by the

        </table>
        <p>The URLs of dynamically generated banners, especially from large banner farms, often don't use the
        well-known image file name extensions, which makes it impossible for <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>
        to guess the file type just by looking at the URL. You can use the <tt class="LITERAL">+block-as-image</tt>
        alias defined above for these cases. Note that objects which match this rule but then turn out NOT to be an
        image are typically rendered as a <span class="QUOTE">"broken image"</span> icon by the browser. Use
        cautiously.</p>

        <p>Now you noticed that the default configuration breaks Forbes Magazine, but you were too lazy to find out
        which action is the culprit, and you were again too lazy to give <a href="contact.html">feedback</a>, so you
        just used the <tt class="LITERAL">fragile</tt> alias on the site, and -- <span class="emphasis"><i class=
        "EMPHASIS">whoa!</i></span> -- it worked. The <tt class="LITERAL">fragile</tt> aliases disables those actions
        that are most likely to break a site. Also, good for testing purposes to see if it is <span class=

        misbehave, and add those to our personalized list of troublemakers:</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Note that the above is not really a good idea: There are exceptions to the filters in <tt class=
        "FILENAME">default.action</tt> for things that really shouldn't be filtered, like code on CVS-&#62;Web
        interfaces. Since <tt class="FILENAME">user.action</tt> has the last word, these exceptions won't be valid for

        <p>You might also worry about how your favourite free websites are funded, and find that they rely on
        displaying banner advertisements to survive. So you might want to specifically allow banners for those sites
