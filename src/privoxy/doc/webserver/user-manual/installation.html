    <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="INSTALLATION" id="INSTALLATION">2. Installation</a></h1>
    <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is available both in convenient pre-compiled packages for a wide range
    of operating systems, and as raw source code. For most users, we recommend using the packages, which can be
    downloaded from our <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ijbswa/" target="_top">Privoxy Project Page</a>.</p>
    <p>Note: On some platforms, the installer may remove previously installed versions, if found. (See below for your
    platform). In any case <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">be sure to backup your old configuration if it is
    valuable to you.</i></span> See the <a href="whatsnew.html#UPGRADERSNOTE">note to upgraders</a> section below.</p>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="INSTALLATION-PACKAGES" id="INSTALLATION-PACKAGES">2.1. Binary Packages</a></h2>
      <p>How to install the binary packages depends on your operating system:</p>
      <div class="SECT3">
        <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="INSTALLATION-DEB" id="INSTALLATION-DEB">2.1.1. Debian and Ubuntu</a></h3>
        <p>DEBs can be installed with <tt class="LITERAL">apt-get install privoxy</tt>, and will use <tt class=
        "FILENAME">/etc/privoxy</tt> for the location of configuration files.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="SECT3">
        <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="INSTALLATION-PACK-WIN" id="INSTALLATION-PACK-WIN">2.1.2. Windows</a></h3>
        <p>Just double-click the installer, which will guide you through the installation process. You will find the
        configuration files in the same directory as you installed <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> in.</p>
        <p>Version 3.0.5 beta introduced full <span class="APPLICATION">Windows</span> service functionality. On
        Windows only, the <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> program has two new command line arguments to
        install and uninstall <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> as a <span class="emphasis"><i class=
        "EMPHASIS">service</i></span>.</p>
        <div class="VARIABLELIST">

            </dd>
          </dl>
        </div>
        <p>After invoking <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> with <b class="COMMAND">--install</b>, you will need
        to bring up the <span class="APPLICATION">Windows</span> service console to assign the user you want
        <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> to run under, and whether or not you want it to run whenever the
        system starts. You can start the <span class="APPLICATION">Windows</span> services console with the following
        command: <b class="COMMAND">services.msc</b>. If you do not take the manual step of modifying <span class=
        "APPLICATION">Privoxy's</span> service settings, it will not start. Note too that you will need to give Privoxy
        a user account that actually exists, or it will not be permitted to write to its log and configuration
        files.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="SECT3">
        <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="INSTALLATION-OS2" id="INSTALLATION-OS2">2.1.3. OS/2</a></h3>
        <p>First, make sure that no previous installations of <span class="APPLICATION">Junkbuster</span> and / or
        <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> are left on your system. Check that no <span class=
        "APPLICATION">Junkbuster</span> or <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> objects are in your startup
        folder.</p>
        <p>Then, just double-click the WarpIN self-installing archive, which will guide you through the installation
        process. A shadow of the <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> executable will be placed in your startup
        folder so it will start automatically whenever OS/2 starts.</p>
        <p>The directory you choose to install <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> into will contain all of the
        configuration files.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="SECT3">
        <h3 class="SECT3"><a name="INSTALLATION-MAC" id="INSTALLATION-MAC">2.1.4. Mac OS X</a></h3>
        <p>Installation instructions for the OS X platform depend upon whether you downloaded a ready-built
        installation package (.pkg or .mpkg) or have downloaded the source code.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="SECT3">
        <h4 class="SECT3"><a name="OS-X-INSTALL-FROM-PACKAGE" id="OS-X-INSTALL-FROM-PACKAGE">2.1.5. Installation from
        ready-built package</a></h4>
        <p>The downloaded file will either be a .pkg (for OS X 10.5 upwards) or a bzipped .mpkg file (for OS X 10.4).
        The former can be double-clicked as is and the installation will start; double-clicking the latter will unzip
        the .mpkg file which can then be double-clicked to commence the installation.</p>
        <p>The privoxy service will automatically start after a successful installation (and thereafter every time your
        computer starts up) however you will need to configure your web browser(s) to use it. To do so, configure them
        to use a proxy for HTTP and HTTPS at the address 127.0.0.1:8118.</p>
        <p>To prevent the privoxy service from automatically starting when your computer starts up, remove or rename
        the file <tt class="LITERAL">/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.ijbswa.privoxy.plist</tt> (on OS X 10.5 and higher) or
        the folder named <tt class="LITERAL">/Library/StartupItems/Privoxy</tt> (on OS X 10.4 'Tiger').</p>
        <p>To manually start or stop the privoxy service, use the scripts startPrivoxy.sh and stopPrivoxy.sh supplied
        in /Applications/Privoxy. They must be run from an administrator account, using sudo.</p>
        <p>To uninstall, run /Applications/Privoxy/uninstall.command as sudo from an administrator account.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="SECT3">
        <h4 class="SECT3"><a name="OS-X-INSTALL-FROM-SOURCE" id="OS-X-INSTALL-FROM-SOURCE">2.1.6. Installation from
        source</a></h4>
        <p>To build and install the Privoxy source code on OS X you will need to obtain the macsetup module from the
        Privoxy Sourceforge CVS repository (refer to Sourceforge help for details of how to set up a CVS client to have
        read-only access to the repository). This module contains scripts that leverage the usual open-source tools
        (available as part of Apple's free of charge Xcode distribution or via the usual open-source software package
        managers for OS X (MacPorts, Homebrew, Fink etc.) to build and then install the privoxy binary and associated
        files. The macsetup module's README file contains complete instructions for its use.</p>
        <p>The privoxy service will automatically start after a successful installation (and thereafter every time your
        computer starts up) however you will need to configure your web browser(s) to use it. To do so, configure them
        to use a proxy for HTTP and HTTPS at the address 127.0.0.1:8118.</p>
        <p>To prevent the privoxy service from automatically starting when your computer starts up, remove or rename
        the file <tt class="LITERAL">/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.ijbswa.privoxy.plist</tt> (on OS X 10.5 and higher) or
        the folder named <tt class="LITERAL">/Library/StartupItems/Privoxy</tt> (on OS X 10.4 'Tiger').</p>
        <p>To manually start or stop the privoxy service, use the Privoxy Utility for Mac OS X (also part of the
        macsetup module). This application can start and stop the privoxy service and display its log and configuration
        files.</p>
        <p>To uninstall, run the macsetup module's uninstall.sh as sudo from an administrator account.</p>

      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="INSTALLATION-SOURCE" id="INSTALLATION-SOURCE">2.2. Building from Source</a></h2>
      <p>The most convenient way to obtain the <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> source code is to download the
      source tarball from our <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ijbswa/files/Sources/" target="_top">project
      download page</a>, or you can get the up-to-the-minute, possibly unstable, development version from <a href=
      "https://www.privoxy.org/" target="_top">https://www.privoxy.org/</a>.</p>
      <p>To build <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> from source, <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html" target="_top">autoconf</a>, <a href=
      "http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html" target="_top">GNU make (gmake)</a>, and, of course, a C compiler
      like <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html" target="_top">gcc</a> are required.</p>
      <p>When building from a source tarball, first unpack the source:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN"> tar xzvf privoxy-3.0.28-stable-src.tar.gz
 cd privoxy-3.0.28-stable</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>To build the development version, you can get the source code by doing:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN">  cd &lt;root-dir&#62;
  git clone https://www.privoxy.org/git/privoxy.git</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>This will create a directory named <tt class="FILENAME">&lt;root-dir&#62;/privoxy/</tt>, which will contain
      the source tree.</p>
      <p>Note that source code in GIT is development quality, and may not be stable or well tested.</p>
      <p>It is strongly recommended to not run <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> as root. You should
      configure/install/run <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> as an unprivileged user, preferably by creating a
      <span class="QUOTE">"privoxy"</span> user and group just for this purpose. See your local documentation for the
      correct command line to do add new users and groups (something like <b class="COMMAND">adduser</b>, but the
      command syntax may vary from platform to platform).</p>
      <p><tt class="FILENAME">/etc/passwd</tt> might then look like:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN">  privoxy:*:7777:7777:privoxy proxy:/no/home:/no/shell</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>And then <tt class="FILENAME">/etc/group</tt>, like:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN">  privoxy:*:7777:</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Some binary packages may do this for you.</p>
      <p>Then, to build from either unpacked tarball or CVS source:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN"> autoheader
 autoconf
 ./configure      # (--help to see options)
 make             # (the make from GNU, sometimes called gmake)
 su               # Possibly required
 make -n install  # (to see where all the files will go)
 make -s install  # (to really install, -s to silence output)</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Using GNU <b class="COMMAND">make</b>, you can have the first four steps automatically done for you by just
      typing:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN">  make</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>in the freshly downloaded or unpacked source directory.</p>
      <p>To build an executable with security enhanced features so that users cannot easily bypass the proxy (e.g.
      <span class="QUOTE">"Go There Anyway"</span>), or alter their own configurations, <b class=
      "COMMAND">configure</b> like this:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN"> ./configure  --disable-toggle  --disable-editor  --disable-force</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Note that all of these options can also be disabled through the configuration file.</p>
      <p><span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">WARNING:</i></span> If installing as root, the install will fail
      unless a non-root user or group is specified, or a <tt class="LITERAL">privoxy</tt> user and group already exist
      on the system. If a non-root user is specified, and no group, then the installation will try to also use a group
      of the same name as <span class="QUOTE">"user"</span>. If a group is specified (and no user), then the support
      files will be installed as writable by that group, and owned by the user running the installation.</p>
      <p><b class="COMMAND">configure</b> accepts <tt class="LITERAL">--with-user</tt> and <tt class=
      "LITERAL">--with-group</tt> options for setting user and group ownership of the configuration files (which need
      to be writable by the daemon). The specified <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">user must already
      exist</i></span>. When starting <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>, it must be run as this same user to
      insure write access to configuration and log files!</p>
      <p>Alternately, you can specify <tt class="LITERAL">user</tt> and <tt class="LITERAL">group</tt> on the <b class=
      "COMMAND">make</b> command line, but be sure both already exist:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN"> make -s install  USER=privoxy GROUP=privoxy</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The default installation path for <b class="COMMAND">make install</b> is <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/local</tt>.
      This may of course be customized with the various <b class="COMMAND">./configure</b> path options. If you are
      doing an install to anywhere besides <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/local</tt>, be sure to set the appropriate paths
      with the correct configure options (<b class="COMMAND">./configure --help</b>). Non-privileged users must of
      course have write access permissions to wherever the target installation is going.</p>
      <p>If you do install to <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/local</tt>, the install will use <tt class=
      "LITERAL">sysconfdir=$prefix/etc/privoxy</tt> by default. All other destinations, and the direct usage of
      <tt class="LITERAL">--sysconfdir</tt> flag behave like normal, i.e. will not add the extra <tt class=
      "FILENAME">privoxy</tt> directory. This is for a safer install, as there may already exist another program that
      uses a file with the <span class="QUOTE">"config"</span> name, and thus makes <tt class=
      "FILENAME">/usr/local/etc</tt> cleaner.</p>
      <p>If installing to <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/local</tt>, the documentation will go by default to <tt class=
      "FILENAME">$prefix/share/doc</tt>. But if this directory doesn't exist, it will then try <tt class=
      "FILENAME">$prefix/doc</tt> and install there before creating a new <tt class="FILENAME">$prefix/share/doc</tt>
      just for <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>.</p>
      <p>Again, if the installs goes to <tt class="FILENAME">/usr/local</tt>, the <tt class=
      "LITERAL">localstatedir</tt> (ie: <tt class="FILENAME">var/</tt>) will default to <tt class="FILENAME">/var</tt>
      instead of <tt class="LITERAL">$prefix/var</tt> so the logs will go to <tt class=
      "FILENAME">/var/log/privoxy/</tt>, and the pid file will be created in <tt class=
      "FILENAME">/var/run/privoxy.pid</tt>.</p>
      <p><b class="COMMAND">make install</b> will attempt to set the correct values in <tt class="FILENAME">config</tt>
      (main configuration file). You should check this to make sure all values are correct. If appropriate, an init
      script will be installed, but it is up to the user to determine how and where to start <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span>. The init script should be checked for correct paths and values, if anything other
      than a default install is done.</p>
      <p>If install finds previous versions of local configuration files, most of these will not be overwritten, and
      the new ones will be installed with a <span class="QUOTE">"new"</span> extension. default.action and
      default.filter <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">will be overwritten</i></span>. You will then need to
      manually update the other installed configuration files as needed. The default template files <span class=
      "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">will</i></span> be overwritten. If you have customized, local templates, these
      should be stored safely in a separate directory and defined in <tt class="FILENAME">config</tt> by the
      <span class="QUOTE">"templdir"</span> directive. It is of course wise to always back-up any important
      configuration files <span class="QUOTE">"just in case"</span>. If a previous version of <span class=
      "APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> is already running, you will have to restart it manually.</p>
