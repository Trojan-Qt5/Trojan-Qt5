    <p>On-the-fly text substitutions need to be defined in a <span class="QUOTE">"filter file"</span>. Once defined,
    they can then be invoked as an <span class="QUOTE">"action"</span>.</p>
    <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> supports three different pcrs-based filter actions: <tt class=
    "LITERAL"><a href="actions-file.html#FILTER">filter</a></tt> to rewrite the content that is send to the client,
    <tt class="LITERAL"><a href="actions-file.html#CLIENT-HEADER-FILTER">client-header-filter</a></tt> to rewrite
    headers that are send by the client, and <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
    "actions-file.html#SERVER-HEADER-FILTER">server-header-filter</a></tt> to rewrite headers that are send by the
    server.</p>
    <p><span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> also supports two tagger actions: <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
    "actions-file.html#CLIENT-HEADER-TAGGER">client-header-tagger</a></tt> and <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
    "actions-file.html#SERVER-HEADER-TAGGER">server-header-tagger</a></tt>. Taggers and filters use the same syntax in
    the filter files, the difference is that taggers don't modify the text they are filtering, but use a rewritten
    version of the filtered text as tag. The tags can then be used to change the applying actions through sections with
    <a href="actions-file.html#TAG-PATTERN">tag-patterns</a>.</p>
    <p>Finally <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> supports the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
    "actions-file.html#EXTERNAL-FILTER">external-filter</a></tt> action to enable <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
    "filter-file.html#EXTERNAL-FILTER-SYNTAX">external filters</a></tt> written in proper programming languages.</p>
    <p>Multiple filter files can be defined through the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
    "config.html#FILTERFILE">filterfile</a></tt> config directive. The filters as supplied by the developers are
    located in <tt class="FILENAME">default.filter</tt>. It is recommended that any locally defined or modified filters
    go in a separately defined file such as <tt class="FILENAME">user.filter</tt>.</p>
    <p>Common tasks for content filters are to eliminate common annoyances in HTML and JavaScript, such as pop-up
    windows, exit consoles, crippled windows without navigation tools, the infamous &lt;BLINK&gt; tag etc, to suppress
    images with certain width and height attributes (standard banner sizes or web-bugs), or just to have fun.</p>
    <p>Enabled content filters are applied to any content whose <span class="QUOTE">"Content Type"</span> header is
    recognised as a sign of text-based content, with the exception of <tt class="LITERAL">text/plain</tt>. Use the
    <a href="actions-file.html#FORCE-TEXT-MODE">force-text-mode</a> action to also filter other content.</p>
    <p>Substitutions are made at the source level, so if you want to <span class="QUOTE">"roll your own"</span>
    filters, you should first be familiar with HTML syntax, and, of course, regular expressions.</p>
    <p>Just like the <a href="actions-file.html">actions files</a>, the filter file is organized in sections, which are
    called <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">filters</i></span> here. Each filter consists of a heading line,
    that starts with one of the <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">keywords</i></span> <tt class=
    "LITERAL">FILTER:</tt>, <tt class="LITERAL">CLIENT-HEADER-FILTER:</tt> or <tt class=
    "LITERAL">SERVER-HEADER-FILTER:</tt> followed by the filter's <span class="emphasis"><i class=
    "EMPHASIS">name</i></span>, and a short (one line) <span class="emphasis"><i class=
    "EMPHASIS">description</i></span> of what it does. Below that line come the <span class="emphasis"><i class=
    "EMPHASIS">jobs</i></span>, i.e. lines that define the actual text substitutions. By convention, the name of a
    filter should describe what the filter <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">eliminates</i></span>. The
    comment is used in the <a href="http://config.privoxy.org/" target="_top">web-based user interface</a>.</p>
    <p>Once a filter called <tt class="REPLACEABLE"><i>name</i></tt> has been defined in the filter file, it can be
    invoked by using an action of the form +<tt class="LITERAL"><a href=
    "actions-file.html#FILTER">filter</a>{<tt class="REPLACEABLE"><i>name</i></tt>}</tt> in any <a href=
    "actions-file.html">actions file</a>.</p>
    <p>Filter definitions start with a header line that contains the filter type, the filter name and the filter
    description. A content filter header line for a filter called <span class="QUOTE">"foo"</span> could look like
    this:</p>
    <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <pre class="SCREEN">FILTER: foo Replace all "foo" with "bar"</pre>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Below that line, and up to the next header line, come the jobs that define what text replacements the filter
    executes. They are specified in a syntax that imitates <a href="http://www.perl.org/" target="_top">Perl</a>'s
    <tt class="LITERAL">s///</tt> operator. If you are familiar with Perl, you will find this to be quite intuitive,
    and may want to look at the PCRS documentation for the subtle differences to Perl behaviour.</p>
    <p>Most notably, the non-standard option letter <tt class="LITERAL">U</tt> is supported, which turns the default to
    ungreedy matching (add <tt class="LITERAL">?</tt> to quantifiers to turn them greedy again).</p>
    <p>The non-standard option letter <tt class="LITERAL">D</tt> (dynamic) allows to use the variables $host, $origin
    (the IP address the request came from), $path, $url and $listen-address (the address on which Privoxy accepted the
    client request. Example: 127.0.0.1:8118). They will be replaced with the value they refer to before the filter is
    executed.</p>
    <p>Note that '$' is a bad choice for a delimiter in a dynamic filter as you might end up with unintended variables
    if you use a variable name directly after the delimiter. Variables will be resolved without escaping anything,
    therefore you also have to be careful not to chose delimiters that appear in the replacement text. For example
    '&#60;' should be save, while '?' will sooner or later cause conflicts with $url.</p>
    <p>The non-standard option letter <tt class="LITERAL">T</tt> (trivial) prevents parsing for backreferences in the
    substitute. Use it if you want to include text like '$&#38;' in your substitute without quoting.</p>
    <p>If you are new to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions" target="_top"><span class=
    "QUOTE">"Regular Expressions"</span></a>, you might want to take a look at the <a href=
    "appendix.html#REGEX">Appendix on regular expressions</a>, and see the <a href=
    "http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html" target="_top">Perl manual</a> for <a href=
    "http://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html" target="_top">the <tt class="LITERAL">s///</tt> operator's syntax</a> and
    <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html" target="_top">Perl-style regular expressions</a> in general. The
    below examples might also help to get you started.</p>
    <div class="SECT2">
      <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="FILTER-FILE-TUT" id="FILTER-FILE-TUT">9.1. Filter File Tutorial</a></h2>
      <p>Now, let's complete our <span class="QUOTE">"foo"</span> content filter. We have already defined the heading,
      but the jobs are still missing. Since all it does is to replace <span class="QUOTE">"foo"</span> with
      <span class="QUOTE">"bar"</span>, there is only one (trivial) job needed:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN">s/foo/bar/</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>But wait! Didn't the comment say that <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">all</i></span> occurrences of
      <span class="QUOTE">"foo"</span> should be replaced? Our current job will only take care of the first
      <span class="QUOTE">"foo"</span> on each page. For global substitution, we'll need to add the <tt class=
      "LITERAL">g</tt> option:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN">s/foo/bar/g</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Our complete filter now looks like this:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN">FILTER: foo Replace all "foo" with "bar"
s/foo/bar/g</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Let's look at some real filters for more interesting examples. Here you see a filter that protects against
      some common annoyances that arise from JavaScript abuse. Let's look at its jobs one after the other:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN">FILTER: js-annoyances Get rid of particularly annoying JavaScript abuse

# Get rid of JavaScript referrer tracking. Test page: http://www.randomoddness.com/untitled.htm
#
s|(&lt;script.*)document\.referrer(.*&lt;/script&gt;)|$1"Not Your Business!"$2|Usg</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Following the header line and a comment, you see the job. Note that it uses <tt class="LITERAL">|</tt> as the
      delimiter instead of <tt class="LITERAL">/</tt>, because the pattern contains a forward slash, which would
      otherwise have to be escaped by a backslash (<tt class="LITERAL">\</tt>).</p>
      <p>Now, let's examine the pattern: it starts with the text <tt class="LITERAL">&lt;script.*</tt> enclosed in
      parentheses. Since the dot matches any character, and <tt class="LITERAL">*</tt> means: <span class=
      "QUOTE">"Match an arbitrary number of the element left of myself"</span>, this matches <span class=
      "QUOTE">"&lt;script"</span>, followed by <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">any</i></span> text, i.e. it
      matches the whole page, from the start of the first &lt;script&gt; tag.</p>
      <p>That's more than we want, but the pattern continues: <tt class="LITERAL">document\.referrer</tt> matches only
      the exact string <span class="QUOTE">"document.referrer"</span>. The dot needed to be <span class=
      "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">escaped</i></span>, i.e. preceded by a backslash, to take away its special meaning
      as a joker, and make it just a regular dot. So far, the meaning is: Match from the start of the first
      &lt;script&gt; tag in a the page, up to, and including, the text <span class="QUOTE">"document.referrer"</span>,
      if <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">both</i></span> are present in the page (and appear in that
      order).</p>
      <p>But there's still more pattern to go. The next element, again enclosed in parentheses, is <tt class=
      "LITERAL">.*&lt;/script&gt;</tt>. You already know what <tt class="LITERAL">.*</tt> means, so the whole pattern
      translates to: Match from the start of the first &lt;script&gt; tag in a page to the end of the last
      &lt;script&gt; tag, provided that the text <span class="QUOTE">"document.referrer"</span> appears somewhere in
      between.</p>
      <p>This is still not the whole story, since we have ignored the options and the parentheses: The portions of the
      page matched by sub-patterns that are enclosed in parentheses, will be remembered and be available through the
      variables <tt class="LITERAL">$1, $2, ...</tt> in the substitute. The <tt class="LITERAL">U</tt> option switches
      to ungreedy matching, which means that the first <tt class="LITERAL">.*</tt> in the pattern will only
      <span class="QUOTE">"eat up"</span> all text in between <span class="QUOTE">"&lt;script"</span> and the
      <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">first</i></span> occurrence of <span class=
      "QUOTE">"document.referrer"</span>, and that the second <tt class="LITERAL">.*</tt> will only span the text up to
      the <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">first</i></span> <span class="QUOTE">"&lt;/script&gt;"</span> tag.
      Furthermore, the <tt class="LITERAL">s</tt> option says that the match may span multiple lines in the page, and
      the <tt class="LITERAL">g</tt> option again means that the substitution is global.</p>
      <p>So, to summarize, the pattern means: Match all scripts that contain the text <span class=
      "QUOTE">"document.referrer"</span>. Remember the parts of the script from (and including) the start tag up to
      (and excluding) the string <span class="QUOTE">"document.referrer"</span> as <tt class="LITERAL">$1</tt>, and the
      part following that string, up to and including the closing tag, as <tt class="LITERAL">$2</tt>.</p>
      <p>Now the pattern is deciphered, but wasn't this about substituting things? So lets look at the substitute:
      <tt class="LITERAL">$1"Not Your Business!"$2</tt> is easy to read: The text remembered as <tt class=
      "LITERAL">$1</tt>, followed by <tt class="LITERAL">"Not Your Business!"</tt> (<span class="emphasis"><i class=
      "EMPHASIS">including</i></span> the quotation marks!), followed by the text remembered as <tt class=
      "LITERAL">$2</tt>. This produces an exact copy of the original string, with the middle part (the <span class=
      "QUOTE">"document.referrer"</span>) replaced by <tt class="LITERAL">"Not Your Business!"</tt>.</p>
      <p>The whole job now reads: Replace <span class="QUOTE">"document.referrer"</span> by <tt class="LITERAL">"Not
      Your Business!"</tt> wherever it appears inside a &lt;script&gt; tag. Note that this job won't break JavaScript
      syntax, since both the original and the replacement are syntactically valid string objects. The script just won't
      have access to the referrer information anymore.</p>
      <p>We'll show you two other jobs from the JavaScript taming department, but this time only point out the
      constructs of special interest:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN"># The status bar is for displaying link targets, not pointless blahblah
#
s/window\.status\s*=\s*(['"]).*?\1/dUmMy=1/ig</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p><tt class="LITERAL">\s</tt> stands for whitespace characters (space, tab, newline, carriage return, form
      feed), so that <tt class="LITERAL">\s*</tt> means: <span class="QUOTE">"zero or more whitespace"</span>. The
      <tt class="LITERAL">?</tt> in <tt class="LITERAL">.*?</tt> makes this matching of arbitrary text ungreedy. (Note
      that the <tt class="LITERAL">U</tt> option is not set). The <tt class="LITERAL">['"]</tt> construct means:
      <span class="QUOTE">"a single <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">or</i></span> a double quote"</span>.
      Finally, <tt class="LITERAL">\1</tt> is a back-reference to the first parenthesis just like <tt class=
      "LITERAL">$1</tt> above, with the difference that in the <span class="emphasis"><i class=
      "EMPHASIS">pattern</i></span>, a backslash indicates a back-reference, whereas in the <span class=
      "emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">substitute</i></span>, it's the dollar.</p>
      <p>So what does this job do? It replaces assignments of single- or double-quoted strings to the <span class=
      "QUOTE">"window.status"</span> object with a dummy assignment (using a variable name that is hopefully odd enough
      not to conflict with real variables in scripts). Thus, it catches many cases where e.g. pointless descriptions
      are displayed in the status bar instead of the link target when you move your mouse over links.</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN"># Kill OnUnload popups. Yummy. Test: http://www.zdnet.com/zdsubs/yahoo/tree/yfs.html
#
s/(&lt;body [^&gt;]*)onunload(.*&gt;)/$1never$2/iU</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Including the <a href=
      "http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Events-20001113/events.html#Events-eventgroupings-htmlevents" target=
      "_top">OnUnload event binding</a> in the HTML DOM was a <span class="emphasis"><i class=
      "EMPHASIS">CRIME</i></span>. When I close a browser window, I want it to close and die. Basta. This job replaces
      the <span class="QUOTE">"onunload"</span> attribute in <span class="QUOTE">"&lt;body&gt;"</span> tags with the
      dummy word <tt class="LITERAL">never</tt>. Note that the <tt class="LITERAL">i</tt> option makes the pattern
      matching case-insensitive. Also note that ungreedy matching alone doesn't always guarantee a minimal match: In
      the first parenthesis, we had to use <tt class="LITERAL">[^&gt;]*</tt> instead of <tt class="LITERAL">.*</tt> to
      prevent the match from exceeding the &lt;body&gt; tag if it doesn't contain <span class=
      "QUOTE">"OnUnload"</span>, but the page's content does.</p>
      <p>The last example is from the fun department:</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <pre class="SCREEN">FILTER: fun Fun text replacements

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Note the <tt class="LITERAL">(?!\.com)</tt> part (a so-called negative lookahead) in the job's pattern, which
      means: Don't match, if the string <span class="QUOTE">".com"</span> appears directly following <span class=
      "QUOTE">"microsoft"</span> in the page. This prevents links to microsoft.com from being trashed, while still
      replacing the word everywhere else.</p>
      <table border="0" bgcolor="#E0E0E0" width="100%">
        <tr>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The <tt class="LITERAL">x</tt> option in this job turns on extended syntax, and allows for e.g. the liberal
      use of (non-interpreted!) whitespace for nicer formatting.</p>

            browser on the content level.</p>
            <p>This filter disables most HTML and JavaScript code that reads or sets cookies. It cannot detect all
            clever uses of these types of code, so it should not be relied on as an absolute fix. Use it wherever you

            opening, yet still allow pop-up windows that the user has explicitly chosen to open. It was added in
            version 3.0.1, as an improvement over earlier such filters.</p>
            <p>Technical note: The filter works by redefining the window.open JavaScript function to a dummy function,
            <tt class="LITERAL">PrivoxyWindowOpen()</tt>, during the loading and rendering phase of each HTML page
            access, and restoring the function afterward.</p>

          <dd>
            <p>This filter removes image tags purely based on what size they are. Fortunately for us, many ads and
            banner images tend to conform to certain standardized sizes, which makes this filter quite effective for ad
            stripping purposes.</p>
            <p>Occasionally this filter will cause false positives on images that are not ads, but just happen to be of
            one of the standard banner sizes.</p>
            <p>Recommended only for those who require extreme ad blocking. The default block rules should catch 95+% of

            <p>Webbugs are small, invisible images (technically 1X1 GIF images), that are used to track users across
            websites, and collect information on them. As an HTML page is loaded by the browser, an embedded image tag
            causes the browser to contact a third-party site, disclosing the tracking information through the requested
            URL and/or cookies for that third-party domain, without the user ever becoming aware of the interaction
            with the third-party site. HTML-ized spam also uses a similar technique to verify email addresses.</p>

            <p>Some web designers seem to assume that everyone in the world will view their web sites using the same
            browser brand and version, screen resolution etc, because only that assumption could explain why they'd use
            static frame sizes, yet prevent their frames from being resized by the user, should they be too small to
            show their whole content.</p>

            <p>Many Microsoft products that generate HTML use non-standard extensions (read: violations) of the ISO

            <p>This filter translates the MS-only characters into Latin-1 equivalents. It is not necessary when using
            MS products, and will cause corruption of all documents that use 8-bit character sets other than Latin-1.
            It's mostly worthwhile for Europeans on non-MS platforms, if weird garbage characters sometimes appear on
            some pages, or user agents that don't correct for this on the fly.</p>

      <p>External filters can be written in any language the platform <span class="APPLICATION">Privoxy</span> runs on
      supports.</p>
      <p>They are controlled with the <tt class="LITERAL"><a href=

      "LITERAL"><a href="config.html#FILTERFILE">filterfile</a></tt> first.</p>
      <p>The header looks like any other filter, but instead of pcrs jobs, external filters contain a single job which
      can be a program or a shell script (which may call other scripts or programs).</p>
      <p>External filters read the content from STDIN and write the rewritten content to STDOUT. The environment
      variables PRIVOXY_URL, PRIVOXY_PATH, PRIVOXY_HOST, PRIVOXY_ORIGIN, PRIVOXY_LISTEN_ADDRESS can be used to get some
