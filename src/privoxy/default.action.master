#############################################################################
# Syntax
#############################################################################
#
# A much better explanation can be found in the user manual which is
# part of the distribution and can be found at https://www.privoxy.org/user-manual
#
# To determine which actions apply to a request, the URL of the request is
# compared to all patterns in this file. Every time it matches, the list of
# applicable actions for this URL is incrementally updated. You can trace
# this process by visiting http://config.privoxy.org/show-url-info
#
# There are 4 types of lines in this file: comments (like this line),
# actions, aliases and patterns, all of which are explained below.
#
#############################################################################
# Pattern Syntax
#############################################################################
#
# 1. On Domains and Paths
# -----------------------
#
# Generally, a pattern has the form <domain>/<path>, where both the <domain>
# and <path> part are optional. The pattern matching syntax is different for
# each. If you only specify a domain part, the "/" can be left out, but it is
# required for the path part.
#
# www.example.com
#   is a domain-only pattern and will match any request to www.example.com
#
# www.example.com/
#   means exactly the same (but is slightly less efficient)
#
# www.example.com/index.html
#   matches only the document /index.html on www.example.com
#
# /index.html
#   matches the document /index.html, regardless of the domain
#
# index.html
#   matches nothing, since it would be interpreted as a domain name and
#   there is no top-level domain called ".html".
#
# 2. Domain Syntax
# ----------------
#
# The matching of the domain part offers some flexible options: If the
# domain starts or ends with a dot, it becomes unanchored at that end:
#
# www.example.com
#   matches only www.example.com
#
# .example.com
#   matches any domain that ENDS in .example.com
#
# www.
#   matches any domain that STARTS with www.
#
# .example.
#   matches any domain that CONTAINS example
#
#
# Additionally, there are wildcards that you can use in the domain names
# themselves. They work pretty similar to shell wildcards: "*" stands for
# zero or more arbitrary characters, "?" stands for one, and you can define
# character classes in square brackets and they can be freely mixed:
#
# ad*.example.com
#   matches adserver.example.com, ads.example.com, etc but not sfads.example.com
#
# *ad*.example.com
#   matches all of the above
#
# .?pix.com
#   matches www.ipix.com, pictures.epix.com, a.b.c.d.e.upix.com etc
#
# www[1-9a-ez].example.com
#   matches www1.example.com, www4.example.com, wwwd.example.com,
#   wwwz.example.com etc, but not wwww.example.com
#
# You get the idea?
#
# 2. Path Syntax
# --------------
#
# Paths are specified as full regular expressions, and are more flexible than
# the domain syntax above. A comprehensive discussion of regular expressions
# wouldn't fit here.
#
# Perl compatible regular expressions are used. See the pcre/docs/ direcory or
# man perlre (also available at http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html) for
# details. The appendix to our User Manual also has some detail.
#
# Please note that matching in the path is CASE INSENSITIVE by default, but
# you can switch to case sensitive by starting the pattern with the "(?-i)"
# switch:
#
# www.example.com/(?-i)PaTtErN.*
#   will match only documents whose path starts with PaTtErN in exactly this
#   capitalization.
#
# Partially case-sensitive and partially case-insensitive patterns are
# possible, but the rules about splitting them up are extremely complex
# - see the PCRE documentation for more information.
#
#############################################################################
# Action Syntax
#############################################################################
#
# There are 3 kinds of actions:
#
# Boolean (e.g. "handle-as-image"):
#   +name  # enable
#   -name  # disable
#
# Parameterized (e.g. "hide-user-agent"):
#   +name{param}  # enable and set parameter to "param"
#   -name         # disable
#
# Multi-value (e.g. "add-header", "filter"):
#   +name{param}  # enable and add parameter "param"
#   -name{param}  # remove the parameter "param"
#   -name         # disable totally
#
# The default (if you don't specify anything in this file) is not to take
# any actions - i.e completely disabled, so Privoxy will just be a
# normal, non-blocking, non-anonymizing proxy.  You must specifically
# enable the privacy and blocking features you need (although the
# provided default actions file will do that for you).
#
# Later actions always override earlier ones.  For multi-valued actions,
# the actions are applied in the order they are specified.
#
#############################################################################
# Valid actions are:
#############################################################################
#
# +add-header{Name: value}
#    Adds the specified HTTP header, which is not checked for validity.
#    You may specify this many times to specify many headers.
#
# +block{reason}
#    Block this URL. Instead of forwarding the request, Privoxy will
#    send a "block" page containing the specified reason.
#
# +change-x-forwarded-for{add}
# +change-x-forwarded-for{block}
#   Adds or blocks the "X-Forwarded-For:" HTTP header in client
#   requests.
#
# +client-header-filter{name}
#    All client headers to which this action applies are filtered on-the-fly
#    through the specified regular expression based substitutions.
#
#    Client-header filters predefined in the supplied default.filter include:
#
#     hide-tor-exit-notation: Removes the Tor exit node notation in Host and Referer headers.
#     privoxy-control:        Removes X-Privoxy-Control headers.
#
# +client-header-tagger{string}
#    Tag requests based on their headers. Client headers to which this
#    action applies are filtered on-the-fly through the specified regular
#    expression based substitutions, the result is used as a tag.
#    Client-header taggers are the first actions that are executed and their
#    tags can be used to control every other action.
#
#    Client-header taggers predefined in the supplied default.filter include:
#
#     image-requests:    Tags detected image requests as "IMAGE-REQUEST".
#     css-requests:      Tags detected CSS requests as "CSS-REQUEST".
#     range-requests:    Tags range requests as "RANGE-REQUEST".
#     client-ip-address: Tags the request with the client's IP address.
#     http-method:       Tags the request with its HTTP method.
#     allow-post:        Tags POST requests as "ALLOWED-POST".
#     complete-url:      Tags the request with the whole request URL.
#     user-agent:        Tags the request with the complete User-Agent header.
#     referer:           Tags the request with the complete Referer header.
#     privoxy-control:   Creates tags with the content of X-Privoxy-Control headers.
#
# +content-type-overwrite
#    Replaces the "Content-Type:" HTTP server header, so that unwanted
#    download menus will not pop up, or changes the browser's rendering mode.
#
# +crunch-client-header{string}
#    Deletes every header sent by the client that contains the string the
#    user supplied as parameter.
#
# +crunch-if-none-match
#     Deletes the "If-None-Match:" HTTP client header.
#
# +crunch-server-header{string}
#    Deletes every header sent by the server that contains the string the
#    user supplied as a parameter.
#
# +deanimate-gifs{last}
# +deanimate-gifs{first}
#    Deanimate all animated GIF images, i.e. reduce them to their last
#    frame. This will also shrink the images considerably. (In bytes,
#    not pixels!)
#    If the option "first" is given, the first frame of the animation
#    is used as the replacement. If "last" is given, the last frame of
#    the animation is used instead, which propably makes more sense for
#    most banner animations, but also has the risk of not showing the
#    entire last frame (if it is only a delta to an earlier frame).
#
# +downgrade-http-version
#    Downgrade HTTP/1.1 client requests to HTTP/1.0 and downgrade the
#    responses as well. Use this action for servers that use HTTP/1.1
#    protocol features that Privoxy currently can't handle yet.
#
# +fast-redirects{check-decoded-url}
# +fast-redirects{simple-check}
#    Many sites, like yahoo.com, don't just link to other sites.
#    Instead, they will link to some script on their own server,
#    giving the destination as a parameter, which will then redirect
#    you to the final target.
#
#    URLs resulting from this scheme typically look like:
#    http://some.place/some_script?http://some.where-else
#
#    Sometimes, there are even multiple consecutive redirects encoded
#    in the URL. These redirections via scripts make your web browsing
#    more traceable, since the server from which you follow such a link
#    can see where you go to. Apart from that, valuable bandwidth and
#    time is wasted, while your browser asks the server for one redirect
#    after the other. Plus, it feeds the advertisers.
#
#    The +fast-redirects{check-decoded-url} option enables interception of
#    these requests by Privoxy, who will cut off all but the last valid URL
#    in the request and send a local redirect back to your browser without
#    contacting the intermediate sites. NOTE: Syntax change as of v.3.0.4.
#
# +filter{name}
#    All files of text-based type, most notably HTML and JavaScript, to which
#    this action applies, can be filtered on-the-fly through the specified
#    regular expression based substitutions. (Note: plain text documents are
#    exempted from filtering, because web servers often use the text/plain
#    MIME type for all files whose type they don't know.) By default,
#    filtering works only on the raw document content itself (that which can
#    be seen with View Source), not the headers. Repeat for multiple filters.
#    Use with caution: filters can be very intrusive.
#
#    Filters predefined in the supplied default.filter include:
#
#     js-annoyances:       Get rid of particularly annoying JavaScript abuse.
#     js-events:           Kill JavaScript event bindings and timers (Radically destructive! Only for extra nasty sites).
#     html-annoyances:     Get rid of particularly annoying HTML abuse.
#     content-cookies:     Kill cookies that come in the HTML or JS content.
#     refresh-tags:        Kill automatic refresh tags if refresh time is larger than 9 seconds.
#     unsolicited-popups:  Disable only unsolicited pop-up windows.
#     all-popups:          Kill all popups in JavaScript and HTML.
#     img-reorder:         Reorder attributes in <img> tags to make the banners-by-* filters more effective.
#     banners-by-size:     Kill banners by size.
#     banners-by-link:     Kill banners by their links to known clicktrackers.
#     webbugs:             Squish WebBugs (1x1 invisible GIFs used for user tracking).
#     tiny-textforms:      Extend those tiny textareas up to 40x80 and kill the hard wrap.
#     jumping-windows:     Prevent windows from resizing and moving themselves.
#     frameset-borders:    Give frames a border and make them resizable.
#     iframes:             Removes all detected iframes. Should only be enabled for individual sites.
#     demoronizer:         Fix MS's non-standard use of standard charsets.
#     shockwave-flash:     Kill embedded Shockwave Flash objects.
#     quicktime-kioskmode: Make Quicktime movies saveable.
#     fun:                 Text replacements for subversive browsing fun!
#     crude-parental:      Crude parental filtering. Note that this filter doesn't work reliably.
#     ie-exploits:         Disable some known Internet Explorer bug exploits.
#     site-specifics:      Cure for site-specific problems. Don't apply generally!
#     no-ping:             Removes non-standard ping attributes in <a> and <area> tags.
#     google:              CSS-based block for Google text ads. Also removes a width limitation and the toolbar advertisement.
#     yahoo:               CSS-based block for Yahoo text ads. Also removes a width limitation.
#     msn:                 CSS-based block for MSN text ads. Also removes tracking URLs and a width limitation.
#     blogspot:            Cleans up some Blogspot blogs. Read the fine print before using this.
#
# +force-text-mode
#    Declares a document as plain text, even if the "Content-Type:" isn't detected
#    as such.
#
# +forward-override{forward .}
# +forward-override{forward 127.0.0.1:8123}
# +forward-override{forward-socks4a 127.0.0.1:9050 .}
# +forward-override{forward-socks4a 127.0.0.1:9050 proxy.example.org:8000}
# +forward-override{forward-socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 .}
# +forward-override{forward-socks5 127.0.0.1:9050 proxy.example.org:8000}
#   This action overrules the forward directives in the configuration file.
#
# +handle-as-empty-document
#   This action alone doesn't do anything noticeable. It just marks URLs. If
#   the block action also applies, the presence or absence of this mark
#   decides whether an HTML "blocked"  page, or an empty document will be sent
#   to the client as a substitute for the blocked content.
#
# +handle-as-image
#    Treat this URL as an image.  This only matters if it's also "+block"ed,
#    in which case a "blocked" image can be sent rather than a HTML page.
#    See +set-image-blocker{} for the control over what is actually sent.
#
# +hide-accept-language{lang}
# +hide-accept-language{block}
#   Deletes or replaces the "Accept-Language:" HTTP header in client
#   requests.
#
# +hide-content-disposition{block}
# +hide-content-disposition{string}
#   Deletes or replaces the "Content-Disposition:" HTTP header set by some
#   servers. This can be used to prevent download menus for content you
#   prefer to view inside the browser, for example.
#
# +hide-from-header{block}
# +hide-from-header{spam@sittingduck.xqq}
#   If the browser sends a "From:" header containing your e-mail address,
#   either completely removes the header ("block"), or change it to the
#   specified e-mail address.
#
# +hide-if-modified-since{block}
# +hide-if-modified-since{-60}
#   Deletes the "If-Modified-Since:" HTTP client header or modifies its
#   value, preventing another way to track users.
#
# +hide-referer{block}
# +hide-referer{forge}
# +hide-referer{http://nowhere.com}
#    Don't send the "Referer:" (sic) header to the web site.  You can
#    block it, forge a URL to the same server as the request (which is
#    preferred because some sites will not send images otherwise) or
#    set it to a constant string.
#
# +hide-referrer{...}
#    Alternative spelling of +hide-referer.  Has the same parameters,
#    and can be freely mixed with, "+hide-referer".  ("referrer" is the
#    correct English spelling, however the HTTP specification has a
#    bug - it requires it to be spelt "referer").
#
# +hide-user-agent{browser-type}
#    Change the "User-Agent:" header so web servers can't tell your
#    browser type.  (Breaks many web sites).  Specify the user-agent
#    value you want - e.g., to pretend to be using Netscape on Linux:
#      +hide-user-agent{Mozilla (X11; I; Linux 2.0.32 i586)}
#    Or to identify yourself explicitly as a Privoxy user:
#      +hide-user-agent{Privoxy/1.0}
#    (Don't change the version number from 1.0 - after all, why tell them?)
#
# +limit-connect{portlist}
#
#    By default, i.e. if no limit-connect action applies, Privoxy
#    allows HTTP CONNECT requests to all ports. Use limit-connect
#    if fine-grained control is desired for some or all destinations.
#    The CONNECT methods exists in HTTP to allow access to secure websites
#    ("https://" URLs) through proxies. It works very simply: the proxy
#    connects to the server on the specified port, and then short-circuits
#    its connections to the client and to the remote server. This means
#    CONNECT-enabled proxies can be used as TCP relays very easily. Privoxy
#    relays HTTPS traffic without seeing the decoded content. Websites can
#    leverage this limitation to circumvent Privoxy's filters. By specifying
#    an invalid port range you can disable HTTPS entirely.
#
#    +limit-connect{443}                   # Only port 443 is OK.
#    +limit-connect{80,443}                # Ports 80 and 443 are OK.
#    +limit-connect{-3, 7, 20-100, 500-}   # Ports less than 3, 7, 20 to 100 and above 500 are OK.
#    +limit-connect{-}                     # All ports are OK
#    +limit-connect{,}                     # No HTTPS/SSL traffic is allowed
#
# +limit-cookie-lifetime{lifetime in minutes}
#
#    This action reduces the lifetime of HTTP cookies coming from the
#    server to the specified number of minutes, starting from the time
#    the cookie passes Privoxy.
#
#    Cookies with a lifetime below the limit are not modified.
#    The lifetime of session cookies is set to the specified limit.
#    The effect of this action depends on the server.
#     If the parameter is "0", this action behaves like session-cookies-only.
#
# +overwrite-last-modified{block}
# +overwrite-last-modified{reset-to-request-time}
# +overwrite-last-modified{randomize}
#    Removing the "Last-Modified:" header is useful for filter testing, where
#    you want to force a real reload instead of getting status code "304",
#    which would cause the browser to reuse the old version of the page.
#
#    The "randomize" option overwrites the value of the "Last-Modified:"
#    header with a randomly chosen time between the original value and the
#    current time. In theory the server could send each document with a
#    different "Last-Modified:" header to track visits without using cookies.
#    "Randomize" makes it impossible and the browser can still revalidate
#    cached documents.
#
#    "reset-to-request-time" overwrites the value of the "Last-Modified:"
#    header with the current time. You could use this option together with
#    hide-if-modified-since to further customize your random range.
#
# +prevent-compression
#    Prevent the website from compressing the data. Some websites do
#    that, which is a problem for Privoxy when built without zlib support,
#    since +filter and +gif-deanimate will not work on compressed data.
#    Will slow down connections to those websites, though.
#
# +server-header-filter{name}
#    All server headers to which this action applies are filtered on-the-fly
#    through the specified regular expression based substitutions.
#
#    Server-header filters predefined in the supplied default.filter include:
#
#     x-httpd-php-to-html:   Changes the Content-Type header from x-httpd-php to html.
#     html-to-xml:           Changes the Content-Type header from html to xml.
#     xml-to-html:           Changes the Content-Type header from xml to html.
#     less-download-windows: Prevent annoying download windows for content types the browser can handle itself.
#     privoxy-control:       Removes X-Privoxy-Control headers.
#
# +server-header-tagger{content-type}
#    Server headers to which this action applies are filtered on-the-fly
#    through the specified regular expression based substitutions, the result
#    is used as a tag. Server-header taggers are executed before all other
#    header actions that modify server headers. Their tags can be used to
#    control all of the other server-header actions, the content filters and
#    the crunch actions (redirect and block).
#
#    Server-header taggers predefined in the supplied default.filter include:
#
#     content-type:    Tags the request with the content type declared by the server.
#     privoxy-control: Creates tags with the content of X-Privoxy-Control headers.
#
# +session-cookies-only
#    If the website sets cookies, make sure they are erased when you exit
#    and restart your web browser.  This makes profiling cookies useless,
#    but won't break sites which require cookies so that you can log in
#    or for transactions.
#
# +set-image-blocker{blank}
# +set-image-blocker{pattern}
# +set-image-blocker{<URL>} with <url> being any valid image URL
#    Decides what to do with URLs that end up tagged with {+block +handle-as-image}.
#    There are 4 options:
#      * "-set-image-blocker" will send a HTML "blocked" page, usually
#         resulting in a "broken image" icon.
#      * "+set-image-blocker{blank}" will send a 1x1 transparent image
#      * "+set-image-blocker{pattern}" will send a 4x4 grey/white pattern
#        which is less intrusive than the logo but easier to recognize
#        than the transparent one.
#      * "+set-image-blocker{<URL>}" will send a HTTP temporary redirect
#        to the specified image URL.
#
#
# +crunch-outgoing-cookies
#    Prevent the website from reading cookies
#
# +crunch-incoming-cookies
#    Prevent the website from setting cookies
#
# +redirect{<URL>}
# +redirect{<pcrs command>}
#    Convinces the browser that the requested document has been moved to
#    another location and the browser should get it from the specified
#    URL.

#
# You can define a short form for a list of permissions - e.g., instead

# you can just write "shop". This is called an alias.
#
# Currently, an alias can contain any character except space, tab, '=', '{'
# or '}'.
# But please use only 'a'-'z', '0'-'9', '+', and '-'.
#
# Alias names are not case sensitive.
#
# Aliases beginning with '+' or '-' may be used for system action names
# in future releases - so try to avoid alias names like this.  (e.g.
# "+crunch-all-cookies" below is not a good name)
#
# Aliases must be defined before they are used.
#

# These aliases just save typing later:
#
+crunch-all-cookies = +crunch-incoming-cookies +crunch-outgoing-cookies
-crunch-all-cookies = -crunch-incoming-cookies -crunch-outgoing-cookies
